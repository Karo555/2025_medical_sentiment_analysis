{"opinion_id": "op_003595", "lang": "en", "text": "I never write reviews, but from now on I will start. The patient pays, invests time, comes in pain, expects help, but gets an ointment for a different problem, which they didn't ask for (10 times more expensive than the one they already use, and almost identical in composition, not a bit more effective) and advice like: please drink flaxseed (I see other patients received such advice too). The immense pain I came with, non-healing wounds on the tongue and in the mouth, were ignored. And for the peak of everything, I consider the answer to a desperate question, what to do (because I didn't get any medication): \"Please don't lick the floor\". This \"witty\" comment speaks for itself. The wounds and canker sores did not heal, on the contrary, new ones appeared, also erosions, the tongue started cracking more and bleeding, the infection also affected the nose and around the nose. The doctor did not help me in the slightest (of course, a swab should have been taken and antibiotics prescribed). I DO NOT RECOMMEND. A waste of time, money, and trust that cannot be rebuilt.", "redacted": 0}
