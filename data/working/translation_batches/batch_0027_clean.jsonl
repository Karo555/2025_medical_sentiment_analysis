I have been losing weight with Anna for over three months and the results have exceeded my wildest expectations - I have already lost 15 kg! She created a very interesting diet tailored to my personal preferences, taking into account my numerous allergies and health problems, and she really didn't have it easy because I am a vegetarian with lactose intolerance, and on top of that I struggle with psoriasis and celiac disease. Despite so many limitations, the menus she creates are interesting and very varied, I don't eat the same thing every day, plus my well-being has improved greatly and numerous skin problems have disappeared after eliminating harmful products. I really highly recommend a visit to Anna Kowalska, she is a dietitian with great knowledge, creativity, she motivates excellently and guides you through the entire weight loss process. It's really worth it!", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_000522", "text": "Nice, approachable. Listens to patients. Explains everything. If an examination or consultation is needed - he refers. There are queues to see him because he doesn't throw the patient out after 3 minutes. The visit lasts at least 20 minutes or more. But it's worth the wait. The patient doesn't get stressed, can calmly say what's bothering them and what worried them. This is very important especially for older people. Although I changed my place of residence and could have changed my doctor, for years I have been using the advice of Dr. Jan Kowalski as my primary care physician. He never refuses to see a patient in need who couldn't manage to book an appointment, though as a result it sometimes extends his regular working hours. A primary care physician doesn't have to know everything. However, they must calmly listen to the patient, and when in doubt or if something exceeds their competence, they should refer the patient for tests or to a specialist. This is the principle that Dr. Jan Kowalski applies.", "lang": "en"}

Huge pain in the buttocks and legs reminiscent of a fall from at least the first floor was mentally exhausting me. From one medication to another, and after discontinuation the same result. Of course my lumbar spine leaves much to be desired but I now know for sure that it is not giving such symptoms. An excellent diagnostician and certainly an excellent physiotherapist.

Unfortunately, it turns out that each subsequent one I decided to be treated by caused me increasing disappointment. All these doctors were only focused on making big money with as little effort as possible on their part. I am embittered, I am extremely sorry, I am afraid that someone will let me down again. I am 47 years old and I wonder if Dr. Jan Kowalski is also recommended for women my age? I would very much appreciate advice.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_000525", "text": "Thanks to the introduction of a stent graft, the aneurysm is not exposed to bleeding and rupture, which is a direct threat to life. Prof. Jan Kowalski said that in one of the patients undergoing the procedure, the aneurysm reached as much as 8 cm, although usually its diameter does not exceed 3.5 cm. Procedures for treating an aneurysm in the aortic arch (located in the mediastinum, between the ascending and descending aorta) are particularly demanding. \"The main difficulty lies in precisely placing the stent graft in the right place, because three vessels branch off from the convex aortic arch: the brachiocephalic trunk, the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. It must therefore be positioned so that the sleeves protruding from the stent graft are exactly at the point where these vessels branch off\" - explained Dr. Jan Kowalski.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_000526", "text": "The level of empathy in people varies, from very low, almost zero, through medium, to very high. Throughout a person's life, empathy can be lost - for example as a result of brain injury or stroke, it can be temporarily blocked, for example in the work of a doctor saving a patient's life, and it can develop - thanks to the neuroplasticity of the brain. Conscious and deliberate development of empathy plays a big role in society, because it is associated with a reduction in the number of people who harm others, as well as the number of people with professional burnout. \"Empathy brings only benefits - to the people we help, but also to ourselves - research has confirmed that the more empathetic a person is, the less depressed they are, and they are also less at risk of professional burnout, which is particularly important in medical professions\" - emphasized Prof. Anna Kowalska.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_000527", "text": "\"Imaging techniques in cardiology have been around for some time. But despite their development, they are still imperfect, because with their help so far it has only been possible to obtain images that are merely virtual reconstructions. With 3D technology it is different. It enables the creation of real, physical models of organs, eliminating the imperfections of imaging techniques\" - said cardiologist Prof. Jan Kowalski, under whose direction the procedure was performed in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. \"It's as if before a patient's procedure we could not only examine their heart in detail, with all its defects literally from all sides, but also touch it. For me as a doctor, the comfort of preparing for the procedure using three-dimensional printing, especially in the case of such serious defects as valve insufficiency, is enormous\" - he added.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_000528", "text": "I was at the doctor's about 2 years ago, it was my first visit to a gynecologist. Unfortunately very unpleasant. I share the opinion of the previous reviewers - the doctor is unpleasant, cannot listen, nor answer questions specifically. During the examination she is indelicate and creates a nervous atmosphere. I was then, probably like most girls going to a gynecologist for the first time, embarrassed and didn't quite know how to behave (you know what I mean) - the doctor downplayed it and embarrassed me more, with sarcastic, unpleasant and unnecessary comments. On top of that she probably has paws (sorry for the expression), not hands, because when she inserted her fingers into my vagina for the examination it hurt a lot, I of course signaled this and of course - deaf silence or after drawing attention again, unpleasant comments. I remember the visit very badly. I do NOT recommend to ANYONE! Because neither a young girl nor an experienced woman likes to be downplayed, embarrassed, ignored and treated unpleasantly by a doctor.

{"opinion_id": "op_000531", "text": "As Prof. Jan Kowalski, Vice President of the Polish Academy of Sciences, said, the introduction of so-called electronic health (e-health) is a logical necessity of the growing availability of computers - within two years there will be 2 billion of them in the world. E-health should bring optimization of health expenditures, improvement in the quality and speed of obtaining services and easier access of the population to information. E-health also includes the increasing popularity of online pharmacies - according to experts, about 10 percent of medicines are already bought this way. This form of sale is more convenient, more discreet and cheaper - but it can lead to abuses, including the delivery of medicines of questionable usefulness (for example transported at the wrong temperature). Reservations are also raised by \"cyber-doctors\" who give advice on the Internet without examining the patient.", "lang": "en"}

Summarizing the visit we are to hope that it will be fine (now there is urethral stricture) and if it is not fine, then we are to report (if the urethra closes up and he cannot urinate).

Each of us of course had different test results (we compared) and different symptoms. Private phone calls during patient visits are the norm.

The doctor cares about the patient's well-being, and I think that should be a priority for a doctor since they became a doctor... but it is not always so. She certainly also takes care of her patients who end up in the hospital where she works, she takes comprehensive care of them, informs them - I had the opportunity to observe this, I was not the doctor's patient but thanks to such people there remains some faith that the patient's well-being is important regardless of where and with whom they are treated and whether their case is more or less serious. After my stay in the hospital I read many opinions about doctors because until then I never had to look for a good gynecologist because everything was always ok, and as we know problems only start when something happens, I didn't know that it is so difficult to find a good doctor and girls write that they change doctors several times before they find the right person and in my feeling the doctor is such a person and although I personally found another gynecologist I think that the doctor is also a good doctor and specialist in her field.", "lang": "en"}

My wife was breastfeeding at the time and the child was unnecessarily exposed to the antibiotic. Two subsequent visits involved changing the ear drops to others with antibiotics.
