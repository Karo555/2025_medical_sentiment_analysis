There is an increasing incidence of some of these diseases. This trend is particularly visible in developed countries - says Dr. Jan Kowalski from the Warsaw University of Life Sciences in an interview with PAP. The remedy for these diseases may turn out to be... parasites, because in order to survive in humans, they had to learn to inhibit the action of the human immune system. \"In the course of evolution, they were our inseparable companions, becoming - like some saprophytic bacteria - a teacher of the immune system so that it would not be overactive. Everything was fine until the beginning of the last century, when the living standards and hygienic-sanitary conditions of most societies were not too high, and antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs were not used as often as today. Parasitic invasions were then commonplace. Now in developed countries: in Europe and the United States, we have gotten rid of some of them. As a result, our immune system has no teacher to curb its excesses\" - explains Jan Kowalski.", "redacted": 2}

I had blood tests done; after looking at them, he said they were okay. My TSH dropped from 5.00 to 0.36, and the doctor claimed that was very good. The only thing I got after a 10-minute visit was a note from a notepad that said 'thyroid ultrasound'. So I paid 168 z≈Ç for that!!!! I have to go for a private ultrasound now and pay again.

Then, such a student should remind their parents to register them again as a family member\" - informed PAP. In an interview with PAP, the chairman of the Polish Students' Parliament (PS RP) Jan Kowalski warned that not only students who worked on the basis of an employment contract might be deregistered from insurance, but also those who worked on the basis of a contract for specific work. \"A large number of students were deregistered from health insurance after the holidays because, for example, they distributed flyers to earn some extra money\" - said Jan Kowalski. He added that students who finished work must take care themselves to inform the insurer (ZUS or KRUS) under which title they are entitled to insurance.

Therefore, a child after the 7th month of life can be given half a yolk every other day. \"However, you need to observe the child's reaction, checking if any skin ailments occur and exclude a possible allergy\" - says Jan Kowalski. A whole egg three to four times a week can be given to children after the 11th month of life. Mustard or mayonnaise should not be added to them. Raw eggs, e.g., in cold cheesecake, as well as raw meats and cold cuts, should also not be given to the child.

Recommendations - wearing the foot in a shoe with a stiff sole, frequent visits (I don't know what their purpose was), applying tapes and shockwave therapy - of course, I had to pay for everything, and a lot (although shockwave therapy, as it turned out, had no justification for a fracture). In the office, the doctor spends 5 minutes, when I ask questions, he brushes me off, doesn't want to explain what's wrong, talks on the phone, in a word, neglects the patient.

After leaving the office, I felt slight relief for about 30-40 minutes, after which the pain returned.

{"opinion_id": "op_000560", "lang": "en", "text": "Acrylamide can be found in crispbread, corn flakes, but primarily in fries or chips. This happens because potatoes are rich in starch and contain the amino acid asparagine. Under the influence of high temperature - above 120 degrees Celsius - after some time, a coupling reaction occurs between asparagine and carbohydrates, resulting in the formation of acrylamide. It is toxic to our nervous system. Many studies have shown that it induces cancer processes. It enters the human body not only through the digestive system but also through the skin - because it is contained in cosmetics and in water. Large amounts of it are produced during cigarette smoking, which is why smokers have several times higher levels of acrylamide than non-smokers.", "redacted": 0}
