Zero coordination, even though if someone has teeth to treat and extract and wants to get braces, I think it should be somehow connected, the dentist with the orthodontist, especially if it's in the same office :) but that's nothing...

I was delighted because everything was going well, and then it's not hard to give praise. Now I see that a good doctor is recognized by how they can help in a difficult situation. Dr. Hodera managed my first pregnancy and at its very beginning encouraged me to have prenatal tests, emphasizing that if they came out bad, I had the right to terminate the pregnancy. Those words stuck with me, and the time until the visit in the 13th week was filled with stress and fears. He didn't explain to me that deciding on the PAPP test also means one must be decided on having an amniocentesis, because it gives 100% certainty. In the end, at that visit, instead of information about the baby's health, I received information that the pregnancy had miscarried. And here begins the situation where the managing doctor should be the first \"stop\" that surrounds the woman with psychological support. Dr. Hodera referred us to the hospital and said a sentence that should never be uttered: 'Maybe it's good that it happened now, because those prenatal tests might have come out bad for us.' No one has the right to say that to a woman who has just lost a child. I later received a referral for several tests that were supposed to explain the cause of the miscarriage. I changed doctors, and before conceiving the second pregnancy, it turned out that I have antiphospholipid syndrome. It was detected thanks to my new doctor. I am now in the 14th week of my second pregnancy, and without injections and proper care, it could end similarly to the first one, so I am glad that I don't have to go through five miscarriages to be correctly diagnosed. Of course, I don't blame Dr. Hodera for what happened, because it was the 'work' of nature, but I really didn't like His approach to losing the pregnancy. Even if the child is sick, we have no right to make judgments like 'it's good that it happened.'", "redacted": 2}
