We came to her a few months ago with a 4-month-old baby suffering from a severe form of atopic dermatitis that was worsening despite following other doctors' recommendations. We had skin scratched to the point of bleeding, a nervous child who slept poorly, skin dry as a chip despite using emollients, hives, and lots of crying. Already after the first visit, we received instructions and tests, which turned out to be a bullseye, and we managed to diagnose additional atypical food allergies (potatoes, rice, and carrots). And so, after a few weeks, our child looks (knock on wood, may it continue) as if nothing had ever been wrong. Thank you very much.", "redacted": 0}

Her opinion on the child's health condition was drastically different from that of other doctors. She didn't pay attention to the child's developmental state. The only authority for her was the hospital discharge summary. Just in case (!!!) without any sensible justification, she prescribed Luminal to the child—a drug given for epilepsy—which, as it turned out, was completely unnecessary for my child. When I asked why I should give it to the child, she stated that she gives it to all premature babies on her ward—then the child sleeps and there is peace (!!!). This lady should study a bit more because her neurological knowledge and methods are behind by quite a few years.", "redacted": 0}

As the only one in Poland, it covers the entire biotech value chain, from the development of innovative cell lines (at Bioceros, a company in the Group, in Utrecht, the Netherlands), through product and process development and production at the Polpharma Biologics branch in Gdańsk, to large-scale production, which will be carried out at a newly built factory in Duchnice near Warsaw. Rzeszotalska explained in an interview with PAP that biotechnology involves using living organisms, mammalian cells, or bacterial cells to produce a drug that is much more effective in treating serious diseases like cancer, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis. \"In these conditions, chemical-based drugs have not proven sufficiently effective,\" she added.", "redacted": 1}

The video recording from the capsule lasts up to 8 hours. The doctor must carefully review this long video material in search of abnormalities in the digestive system. The Polish company CTAdventure, thanks to funds from the National Center for Research and Development, is working on GastroView software for image analysis. It will pick out those fragments in the video recording that the doctor should pay special attention to. \"Using our software is intended to enable efficient and reliable analysis of films made via a camera placed in a capsule,\" says Dawid Jereczek from CTAdventure in an interview with PAP. \"This will shorten the time needed to analyze the recording and reduce the number of hours the doctor must devote to it.\" The PAP interviewee claims that the program would select from the entire material the fragments that require special attention. Currently, an examination using an endoscopic capsule can cost up to 4-5 thousand PLN. Jereczek believes, however, that if the software were used, the cost of the examination could drop by at least half. \"It is not excluded that someday such examinations will be reimbursed.

She adds that in small amounts, this compound causes abdominal pain and vomiting. However, if its concentration in water exceeds the norms for a longer time, it can lead to damage to the liver, heart, and brain, as well as the development of cancers, especially leukemia, lymphoma, and bladder cancer. \"Methods for quick and cheap removal of trichloroethylene from water are therefore of significant social importance,\" she says. Speaking about the details of the research, doctoral student Izabela I. Kamińska (IChF PAN) explains that organic chlorine compounds can be removed from water using a reaction known as hydrodechlorination. \"It uses small amounts of hydrogen and a suitably chosen catalyst, usually palladium. This leads to a reaction in which the chloroorganic compounds contained in water are transformed into non-toxic substances—saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In the case of a reaction with trichloroethylene, these are ethane and ethylene,\" she recounts.", "redacted": 2}
{"opinion_id": "op_001151", "lang": "en", "text": "As Tomasz Nocuń, head of the finance department at Selvita, emphasizes, such projects in Poland are unique. Most research conducted by our pharmaceutical companies concerns generic drugs. Here, however, drugs protected by new, original patents will be created. The total cost of developing and introducing a new drug to the market is currently beyond the reach of Polish entities—if the cost of failed projects is taken into account, it exceeds a billion dollars. Therefore, the company is looking for a partner—a pharmaceutical company that will take over the development of the drug in the final phases. In Nocuń's opinion, such projects deserve funding from public funds because thanks to them, the sector of companies implementing the regional development strategy and the National Smart Specialization is developing in Poland. Biotechnology and pharmacy are businesses that employ many scientists—out of over 240 people working in the Selvita Group, the vast majority are scientists, and over 70 have a doctoral degree.", "redacted": 1}

The procedure was complicated and risky. The professor explained matter-of-factly, clarified, presented various solutions and their possible effects, performed the procedure, and now... The patient has been in the intensive care unit for over 2 weeks after the operation. Visits take place at a specified time. Then you can count on the patient being prepared for the visit. I had the opportunity to see the patient at 11:00 and I was shocked. Lateral positioning. Both hands tightly and stiffly tied with a regular bandage to the bed. Activities related to excretion had not been performed since morning. My intervention was met with understanding by the staff because the ladies knew very well about it but were engaged in a passionate discussion in a respectable group. Each time I demanded to speak with a doctor, but that was a serious mistake. The doctor suspected pneumonia. In the evening, I allowed myself to call and obtained confirmation. 'Yes, I am sure it is pneumonia.' After a few days, when I was visiting the patient with his closest family, the esteemed doctor firmly denied that any pneumonia could have occurred. Asking the doctor how he assesses today's condition, I heard... 'What, am I a fortune teller?' - I don't think so because I expected a doctor at the hospital and I wasn't scheduled for a fortune teller's office. The neurosurgeon consultation was a complete farce. He appeared on the ward (the patient's condition was significantly worsening) The doctor claims that maybe even today the procedure will take place because hydrops have appeared, which are probably the cause of the poor condition so far and even its worsening, then literally a moment later he claims that there will be no procedure because the hydrops were already there before (so they probably still are) so there is no such need, and the last tomography might even be better than the last one. And I ask where is the patient who is suffering and aware that he is starting to die and the completely confused family? The abused patient, who was disconnected from the ventilator for 24 hours and then reconnected, the oozing postoperative wound at such a time. He can communicate with me by lip movement. He asks... take me away from here... I will die here alone. He hears... so maybe a psychologist could provide him with support... maybe a priest...
