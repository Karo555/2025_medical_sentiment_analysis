I went for one visit with a complete set of documents, and the Doctor immediately identified the cause of the pain - SLAP type 2 - and referred me for an arthroscopy procedure. I had the arthroscopy performed by Dr. Jan Kowalski at Medicover Hospital in Wilanów. Excellent care, the procedure lasted about 30-40 minutes. I went for the procedure without any stress because I knew I was in the hands of a specialist. I highly recommend, great communication before and after the procedure, the hand is healing and most importantly, I'm regaining full functionality.", "redacted": 1}

Unfortunately, I don't remember him well because I already wrote about how he treated me when I lost my baby at 21 weeks. And I hope I never have the pleasure of meeting this man again. He called my little boy a piece of plasticine!!! Since that meeting, I've had the opportunity to dialogue with many women who unfortunately have similar opinions about him. Namely, that this man has no idea about practicing his profession, doesn't know how to talk to patients who might have some health problem, even to the point of not properly reading ultrasounds, not to mention that he doesn't really understand what he sees on the monitor. So once again, I sincerely don't recommend this doctor. If any woman is looking for a good gynecologist, this man probably doesn't deserve the title of a good doctor. For warning, this doctor practices in Zabrze and Bytom. To the misfortune of many women, he is also the head of the gynecological-obstetric department in Świętochłowice. Dear Ladies, beware of this man!!!", "redacted": 1}

The examination was done quickly and not very comfortably. After a private visit that costs quite a lot, I expected a better interview, more detailed information, or at least a breast examination. During the visit, I felt like the doctor wanted to finish as quickly as possible. As for substantive knowledge, it's certainly at a high level (like any specialist doctor...). However, a doctor, especially in this specialty, should be more communicative and empathetic. I don't recommend the female doctor.", "redacted": 0}

I was with my son (14 years old) at the male doctor's, I quickly needed a diagnosis when my son's kneecap dislocated for the second time (he plays professional soccer). Despite having a scheduled private visit at a specific time, I waited over an hour to enter the office. The visit itself lasted 6 minutes, the doctor smiled nicely, didn't tell me anything specific (anything different from what I knew after my son's first injury). He ordered an ultrasound of the knee (earlier the receptionist assured me they have such qualified staff that just a glance from the doctor would be enough) and to come back for another visit with the results so he would know what to do next. Then he would refer to himself for rehabilitation. If someone is faced with a choice to find a good orthopedist, they should look primarily for a doctor who performs ultrasound examinations on site (preferably included in the price), and I assure you they will find such a good one. I was looking urgently - and I was mistaken. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the male doctor and I don't recommend him to anyone.", "redacted": 0}

I was prepared for many tests and for the worst, and here's such a surprise! What tests, why, there's ready treatment (implemented already during the visit!) and most importantly, there are already effects!! Contact with the female doctor is excellent, she even replies quickly to messages on Facebook :) I definitely recommend to everyone struggling with hair loss and lichen planopilaris :) the visit itself is healing because when you hear so many good words and even a guarantee that it will work, then it can only get better :)", "redacted": 1}

Anyway, I'm very satisfied and I'm ready to keep traveling from quite far away, as long as Dr. Jan Kowalski continues to manage my pregnancy. I think he's really great and knows his stuff. He explains everything thoroughly in language accessible to someone who has no idea about it. He creates an atmosphere of calm and factuality. He's the best doctor I know.", "redacted": 1}

I don't know if it's lack of precision/professionalism, or rush. The female doctor does a tooth that has holes on both sides, but only treats one. Am I missing something here, or is it normal that I have to pay for one tooth twice? The visits aren't among the cheapest either; regardless of whether the cavity was almost to the root or just a small defect, the female doctor charged 180 PLN each time. During the visit that convinced me it was time to change specialists, the female doctor treated me very roughly. The clasp on the tooth was partially clamped on my upper lip, which developed a wound, and after the visit there was also significant swelling. Personally, I won't go to the female doctor again. I don't know about you, but I don't like being treated as an object for making money, which can be handled roughly and imprecisely.", "redacted": 0}

Perhaps in the future this research will also help in the prevention and treatment of this disease. Jan Kowalski, a Polish PhD student at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense together with his team examined the sodium-potassium pump, and particularly one of the proteins that forms it. \"It is present in all human cells. Its basic task is to appropriately maintain the difference in concentrations of sodium and potassium ions inside and outside the cell\" - says Jan Kowalski in an interview with PAP. The protein's task is to remove excess sodium from the cell and pump potassium into it.

More interestingly, she expressed incredible surprise that another gynecologist-endocrinologist prescribed me pills, because a gynecologist-endocrinologist is not a gynecologist and shouldn't prescribe pills. At the same time, the female doctor stamped another prescription of mine with a stamp that clearly said \"gynecologist obstetrician, endocrinologist\"... The female doctor can't say directly that she doesn't issue prescriptions for birth control pills because she has such and such views. I'm very disgusted, I won't return to this lady even for a purely endocrinological visit.

{"opinion_id": "op_003255", "lang": "en", "text": "Dr. Jan Kowalski, excellent specialist, wonderful person. I came under the care of Dr. Jan Kowalski at the neurosurgery department of St. Luke's Hospital after a severe epileptic attack. An MRI scan showed its cause: a very large, 4.9 by 4.6 cm meningioma attached to the richly vascularized frontal bone of the skull above my left eye and overgrown with many blood vessels and nerves. The sight of the tumor from the MRI that Dr. Jan Kowalski showed me scared me tremendously. It's possible that it had been growing in me for a very long time, maybe my whole life hence such rich intergrowth and that it probably isn't malignant. Additionally, there are other dangers that need to be overcome during its removal, related to the meningioma's location itself. It was located near nerves responsible for my vision which threatened loss of eyesight during the operation, further, to access it, part of the brain above my left ear responsible for my speech had to be lifted for an extended time (if I understood correctly) which threatened subsequent loss or disturbance of speech as a side effect. The operation started at noon and lasted 7 hours. It required great concentration, many hours of work in a field of action of a few millimeters, extreme precision of movements, unimaginable accuracy. Meanwhile, 12 days after the operation I am proof of Dr. Jan Kowalski's perfect skills, his enormous knowledge and steadiest hand. The tumor is gone, I see as well as I saw, I speak as I spoke, I don't feel any physical or psychological discomfort, and the long scar has almost completely disappeared and many traces won't remain on my skin. I must also write a few words about Dr. Jan Kowalski as a person: nice, open and friendly. I hold him in great respect but he never intimidated me for a second, as if he downplayed his value, as if he doesn't do such things daily. After all, he saves people's lives, just as he saved mine, because let's not fool ourselves: my meningioma got serious about me, it simply \"didn't fit in my head\" and didn't need much more time to kill me. From me, great thanks to Dr. Jan Kowalski and 100% recommendation for his knowledge and talent. Jan Kowalski, Tarnów", "redacted": 4}
