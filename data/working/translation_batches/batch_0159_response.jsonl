By chance, after a visit to a dermatologist, I had the rest checked and unfortunately it turned out that my problem wasn't just related to the thyroid.

Additionally, he doesn't push for follow-up visits if he knows it's unnecessary, doesn't pressure, doesn't make you buy medications if he knows it won't be needed. He knows his stuff, I especially recommend him if someone has knee problems. Greetings to Dr. Jan! :)", "redacted": 1}

However, the vibe of the visit was terrible, and that's something a patient never expects after a visit to a private practice. Even if the patient's problem is \"imaginary\" (quote from the female doctor), a doctor, especially one practicing in a private clinic, has no right to use such a condescending tone and have \"goodbye\" written on their forehead with every question asked. I remind you that the visit is not free. I regret leaving any money there and that I didn't share my opinion about her attitude towards the patient with Pani Janeczko strongly enough.", "redacted": 1}

The others only said it was nothing serious, that it's the same thing I had as a child. Prof. Harat's approach disappointed me. He is not at all \"like a father,\" nor is he nice. I didn't have the chance to talk to him at all in the hospital, even though he scheduled my surgery. I saw him once in the hallway as he was walking around. Apparently, he visited others even after surgery. I didn't have that \"privilege.\" During the private visit, which wasn't cheap either (300 zł), I learned that I had a tumor to remove and that he didn't know what the rest was. So if he doesn't know, who should know? Probably only God. He pointed with his finger that the tumor was on the left side of the forehead, but it turned out to be right in the center of the brain. Today I am already post-surgery and feel well. Do I recommend him? Rather yes, despite him not being nice.", "redacted": 1}

Nice, polite, a doctor with an approach to children - yes, everything matched. Over time, the delight faded. I noticed that the doctor sometimes pretends to remember the little patient. The same tricks with giving the child a stethoscope, high-fiving, and making a turtle. Now I perceive the doctor's politeness differently. Each of us expects that, especially when going privately. Another matter - more important. It's hard to treat a child with a doctor whose appointments can only be scheduled 2-4 weeks later depending on the season. If you want to make an urgent appointment for a child - there's practically no chance for a visit on the same or next day. So the child is treated by someone else - the National Health Fund, emergency help, or another doctor. As for the treatment itself (in my opinion, this is the most important thing and I encourage parents to evaluate treatment results, not \"smiles\"), she did not detect the real cause of my child's illness. She is reluctant to prescribe recommended vaccines, referring to the National Health Fund doctor, even though she encourages getting vaccinations. I must also note the constant delays in appointments. On average, you wait an extra 30-40 minutes. Several times, she mildly undermined the opinions of other specialist doctors. Overall, a doctor who evokes mixed feelings. I won't say she \"shines\" with knowledge and always makes accurate diagnoses. I also don't know if I would recommend Dr. Gajewska to other parents despite the emphasized 27 years of experience. It's not bad, but she hasn't really helped us much yet either.", "redacted": 1}

A year ago, my mother had thyroid radioiodine therapy ordered by Dr. Anna Kowalska.

Besides, the doctor solved the mystery of the elevated calcium level in the blood – it was enough to change one medication and now everything is normal. When a problem arose, I could contact the doctor even outside the scheduled appointment. She never made me feel like I was bothering her or that I was an unwanted intruder, even though I showed up unannounced in front of the office or in the hospital hallway.
