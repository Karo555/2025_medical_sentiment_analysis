{"opinion_id": "op_002341", "lang": "en", "text": "Hello! I am pregnant, and Dr. Jan Kowalski is managing my pregnancy - so far, I am very satisfied. At every ultrasound, my husband is with me; the doctor explains everything, and I always want to know a lot :)) He explains in detail, and no questions surprise him; he ignores none. Admittedly, there is a bit of a wait for the appointment (in the waiting room), but that doesn't reflect poorly on him as a doctor (probably an organizational issue, I don't know :), sometimes patients also don't listen to advice about arrival times and do things \"their way\"). Every patient (regardless of age and appearance!!!!) spends at least 20 minutes in the office, pregnant women often longer (I usually spend about 30-40 minutes). The doctor also gives advice on proper diet, converses quite directly, but there's nothing inappropriate about it. He always asks about the woman's expectations for the visit, even about consent for an internal exam (recently, my husband was with me, so besides me, he also asked him if he could examine me). I simply focus on perceiving Dr. Jan Kowalski as a doctor you can REALLY talk to and who reads ultrasound images well. I don't judge or register whether he looked at me this way or that and what it might mean!!!! He should do his job, and as long as he does, I have no objections!!!! I'll add that the doctor doesn't search for fetal anomalies, doesn't invent diseases that aren't there, and doesn't push for frequent visits. In my case, so far, nothing bad is happening, even though this is my second pregnancy and my first child was barely saved (delivery), so one could worry. Every visit starts with a brief reminder of the outcome of my first pregnancy and subsequent hospital stays - at His explicit request. I feel sorry for the ladies whom the situation forced to write such bad opinions, but I think it's all a matter of perception and an unfortunate coincidence. HOWEVER, I RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR!!!!", "redacted": 1}

{"opinion_id": "op_002343", "lang": "en", "text": "When I got pregnant \"quickly,\" I was looking for a gynecologist whom I could 100% trust during such a special time as pregnancy. I came across Dr. Jan Kowalski almost by chance. The Doctor gives the patient a sense of security, a feeling that all examinations and the pregnancy are conducted professionally. He answers all questions in detail, not dismissing any doubts. You can call the Doctor at any time; there are no problems with long \"trying to get through,\" as with some doctors. This gives great comfort and a sense that care isn't just about monthly visits and prescribing tests. Besides professionalism, one more thing is noticeable – so important – a warm, empathetic approach to patients. Dr. Jan Kowalski managed my pregnancy from the beginning until the very delivery - a cesarean section, which I also remember very well. In the hospital, I didn't feel left alone; the Doctor checked in, remembered. Doctor, I thank you with all my heart for the care during such an important time for me and my husband, thank you for safely bringing our daughter into the world, for every kind word, smile, and advice. Warm regards!", "redacted": 1}

My 7-month-old daughter started running a fever on Friday; on Saturday, we went to the on-duty doctor at the Olkusz hospital, where after examination by the on-duty doctor, it turned out the little one had an ear infection; the doctor prescribed antibiotics and that was it. However, something didn't sit right with me, and we went for a visit to Dr. Jan Kowalski; his diagnosis differed from the previous one; he stated that the little one had roseola (he wasn't afraid to write it in the health book, unlike the first doctor). We trusted his diagnosis, and indeed it turned out that our daughter had roseola (the fever subsided after three days, and spots appeared on her chest). However, leaving the doctor, I had mixed feelings because he is quite a gloomy person, but after all, he is there to treat, not entertain the child. We personally recommend.", "redacted": 1}

I think there might have been falsification of test results as well.

{"opinion_id": "op_002349", "lang": "en", "text": "Some time ago, I had a consultation, based on which I decided NOT to undergo surgery with Dr. Jan Kowalski. Scheduled for a specific time, I approached the reception. The lady was more interested in a private phone conversation than directing me to the doctor. I waited an additional half hour, even though I was scheduled for a specific time. When I finally managed to enter the office, the doctor was just about to leave, saying he had to go somewhere and would be back in 20 minutes. To which I said if he leaves now, I'll leave with him and not come back. The consultation was about breast augmentation. (I had two other consultations, and this was the worst.) The doctor was poorly interested in explaining contraindications, complications after the procedure - he wasn't interested in talking at all. Planning to spend 14 thousand zł, I expected more engagement. At the end, I found out I wouldn't get a computer printout of the implant selection because it couldn't be printed. And I paid more for using this program than for consultations with other doctors. A few weeks later, I received a call from the clinic informing me that I had a reserved date and needed to pay a deposit, even though I hadn't reserved any date. I am disgusted and disappointed with the level of service provided by the most recommended surgeon in Wrocław.", "redacted": 1}

Unlike some doctors, he looks at a person as a whole, not just focusing on one part. I decided to visit Mr. Jan because for a long time my knee was bothering me, and then pains in my leg appeared. The orthopedist took the easiest route and stated it was degeneration of both knees, even though only one was bothering me, and prescribed quite expensive glucosamine, claiming that only this is a medicine and works, and the rest are supplements. Regarding the leg, he said it probably radiates from the spine and only prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug. Thanks to Mr. Jan, I know what's wrong with me and that the problem lies in hip dysfunction and improper muscle work. He applied acupuncture; the method isn't the most pleasant, but it's bearable and brings results. It was better after the first treatment. Additionally, there is self-therapy and learning exercises tailored to the patient to achieve the intended and long-lasting effect, not just temporary improvement. Thanks to this, I know how to help myself and prevent recurrence of ailments. It's really worth going to Mr. Jan instead of wasting time on ineffective treatment and spending money on medications that don't work.", "redacted": 1}

Generally, the doctor conducted a broad interview with me, asked about coexisting diseases, medications taken; the visit proceeded without rush, she was thorough, observant; it was visible that she is an experienced doctor and doesn't make diagnoses hastily. She asked about another visible dermatological condition whether it's been there for a long time, and even though I mentioned that I've heard many diagnoses about it, she didn't state her own. Maybe because she didn't ask me directly what I think about it, or maybe because during 1 visit, only 1 problem is solved.", "redacted": 0}

The doctor is a wonderful person, full of understanding, doesn't rush anything, doesn't judge, and in this difficult time, she is a point of support and anchor.

I decided to consult a dietitian not only to lose weight but also to support my treatment with a proper diet. I received professional advice and a nutritional plan from Anna, which wasn't simple to construct because it had to consider my health problems as well as working 3 shifts. I treated these consultations primarily as training to eliminate dietary mistakes and to learn how to balance meals myself. After a month of strictly following Anna's recipes, I started adapting my favorite dishes to the principles of healthy eating I learned from Anna. Anna provided advice and support even outside the office, and free of charge, answering all questions exhaustively. After a few months of following Anna's recommendations, not only did my health improve significantly, but I also lost weight from size 44 to size 36 without ever being hungry or frustrated. My whole family also benefited from changing my eating style - household members are healthier and much slimmer. I intend to continue using Anna's recommendations because they worked in practice.", "redacted": 1}
