Instead of providing reliable answers to questions asked, he prefers to mock and treat the patient like an uneducated fool, emphasizing that \"his stethoscope cost several thousand, and the diaphragm alone cost 700 PLN\" (words directed at a six-year-old!). Clearly, the doctor is a world-renowned specialist in every field, since upon seeing a child for the first time, he auscultates them and then prescribes an inhaled steroid because he \"diagnoses\" an allergy (to an unknown agent) and claims a consultation with an allergist is unnecessary.

{"opinion_id": "op_000643", "text": "I have had two episodes of depression so far, which I treated in consultation with a psychiatrist. The first one I treated with Dr. Jan Kowalski, the second one with another psychiatrist in Krakow. Dr. Jan Kowalski prescribed me medication which helped me get out of the depression temporarily, however, I experienced a relapse. When I managed to get out of the first episode, I was very grateful to him and even recommended him to friends. Now, after the second episode, I see his role completely differently and I would certainly not recommend him to anyone anymore. I rate my psychiatrist in Krakow orders of magnitude better. Above all, Dr. Jan Kowalski did not make enough effort to at least superficially understand the causes of my condition. He only took a very basic medical history (asked about a family history of depression, substance use, etc.), diagnosed \"lowered mood,\" and immediately prescribed antidepressants. Afterwards, practically the only thing he was interested in was whether there were any side effects and how I felt. He did not refer me for psychotherapy right away, and it is psychotherapy (I know this only now) that is the key to actually dealing with the problems once and for all. In his defense, I must say that after 1.5 years from starting the treatment, the summer holidays began and I was away from Warsaw for a long time. However, I informed the doctor about this in advance, and today I would expect him even more so to devote time to me and explain how I should continue treatment and that it is crucial to remain in contact with a doctor (not necessarily him). At the beginning of the second episode, I was abroad and decided to contact the doctor by phone. It was difficult; the doctor first didn't have time for me, and the second time he devoted a whole 3 minutes of his precious time to me. Even though, if there was a justified suspicion that I had depression, he knew how much I was suffering and how much it cost me to even make a simple phone call to him. Overall, I have a deep sense that the doctor didn't try hard enough in my case. I can't say if I was unlucky or if Dr. Jan Kowalski treats all patients with such attention. However, I am convinced there are better doctors than him.", "lang": "en"}

The basic way is to ensure proper ventilation and airing of buildings, especially basements, where this gas accumulates the most. Others include controlling building materials, proper selection of land for house construction, sealing cracks in foundations and places where utilities enter buildings, and using protective foil. In Poland, a draft law for implementing the EU directive has already been prepared. It proposes, among other things, mandatory radon measurements in workplaces. \"We need to raise people's awareness so they know the potential effects of natural radiation. It is necessary to establish a so-called radon plan for Poland.

I warn pregnant patients, and especially those overweight, to choose a different doctor! The doctor received me with about a 30-minute delay, spent the next 20 minutes typing test results into the computer, then asked me some strange question about surgery, and upon seeing my shocked face exclaimed: what's your name? I gave my first and last name, and he said: well, you didn't say. Hmmmm... the doctor was typing my results into another patient's file!!! Maybe if he hadn't been so delayed and asked for my name at the beginning, he would have saved 20 minutes. Unfortunately, that was the beginning of this awful visit - the worst experience of my life. Then the doctor claimed he couldn't find me on today's patient list, scrolled back and forth for 5 minutes, and then asked me to leave (!) the office. I went downstairs quite shaken to the reception, where the EnelMed receptionist found me on the list without any problem. I was apologized to by the reception and sent upstairs again (I had already wasted about 60 minutes solely due to the doctor's fault). The doctor finally saw me, but didn't even apologize for the delay or for asking me to leave the office. I was already crying and shaken by such treatment, especially since I came with a threatened pregnancy and didn't expect such running between floors and humiliation. To my question of whether the results I presented posed a risk to the pregnancy, he answered that the biggest risk was my weight. I'm just speechless. I know I should have filed a proper complaint with the facility's management, but I didn't only because I was already tired of it all. I do not recommend this doctor; if I could, I would give him a zero. P.S.

Two months have passed since the full rhinoplasty I underwent, and frankly, I lack the words to describe how happy I am. Dr. Jan Kowalski - a professional in every respect, has vast knowledge and experience, and is an extremely friendly, sensitive, and empathetic person. With angelic patience and calm, he answers all questions, which greatly helps reduce the stress and tension before the procedure. Incredibly talented and gifted - you can be completely calm about the results. With great passion and a sparkle in his eye, he helps his patients. The result is incredible! Just after 7 days (after the cast removal), when I could see my nose in all its glory for the first time, I was moved to tears of happiness. The nose was already ideal then - symmetrical, straight, and wonderfully matched to the shape and size of my face. Since then, it only gets more beautiful every day. If I had to make the decision to have surgery again - I would without hesitation choose Dr. Jan Kowalski again (the best choice possible!). I am delighted with both the result and the entire process. The procedure is completely painless. I highly recommend the Doctor - he handles impossible things immediately, and it's really worth fighting for yourself and starting a better life - without complexes! :)", "lang": "en"}
