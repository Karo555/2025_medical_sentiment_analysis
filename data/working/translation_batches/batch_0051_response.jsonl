It is a genetic pattern of a long-lived person in good condition. It takes the form of a database to which the genetic data of any Polish patient can be referenced to offer them precise genomic diagnostics. Life expectancy and the number of elderly people will increase in the near future. As Dr. hab. Anna Kowalska from the Institute of Cell Biology and Molecular Biology said, individuals over 90 years old were selected for the study, those without problems with daily living activities (at least 4 points out of 6 possible), without serious memory and cognitive function issues (at least 20 points out of 30 possible), who before the age of 80 had not suffered from type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart attack, or cancer, and had normal or nearly normal biochemical test results.", "redacted": 1}

Therefore, a group of children not yet affected by chronic or civilization diseases was selected for the study. These children are between 8 and 12 years old, attending primary school no. 45 in Sosnowiec, located a few hundred meters from the headquarters of the Faculty of Earth Sciences at the University of Silesia (where continuous air quality monitoring is conducted). The children - besides allergy tests - underwent, among others, spirometric tests checking lung capacity; along with their parents, they also filled out monthly cards with detailed questions about observed body reactions.", "redacted": 0}

An exception to this rule is observed only when some major sports competitions are organized, which are usually accompanied by higher drug consumption. Researchers also calculated that in the months they considered, the highest consumption concerned methamphetamine, then amphetamine, and in third place - ecstasy. The level of cocaine in the samples was low - at the limit of the device's sensitivity. Cannabinoids could not be determined. \"Perhaps because these substances degrade very quickly in sewage, and Poznań has one treatment plant, so before they reach it, they have to travel a longer distance\" - assessed dr Anna.", "redacted": 2}

However, January 10 of this year turned out to be, so far, the worst day of my life. I woke up and could not get up. I could not walk, lie down - simply live normally. The pain in my left leg was unbearable. Further rehabilitations, strong medications did not help, even worsened my condition. I sought advice from several neurosurgeons - the so-called top 5 of Warsaw medicine - all unanimously stated - SURGERY. However, none of the above-mentioned persons could guarantee me that the procedure would improve my situation, some even claimed it could be worse. I sought help from many specialists until, thanks to the portal and positive reviews, I came to pan Jan. Finally, I found a specialist who, without beating around the bush, presented dry facts based on many years of experience. At the beginning of March this year, we started difficult and long rehabilitation. It's June, and I feel great - I exercise daily at home, returned to an active lifestyle, and with each day, the vision of surgery disappears beyond the horizon :) Honestly, with full conviction, I recommend cooperation with pan Jan - a professional in every respect, and on top of that, an incredible person.
