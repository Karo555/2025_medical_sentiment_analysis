Every year in Poland, about 1,100-1,200 new cancer cases are diagnosed among children up to 17 years of age. The most common childhood cancer in Poland is cancers of the hematopoietic system - leukemias. They account for about 26% of all childhood cancers. \"The symptoms of hematological diseases are non-specific, they may resemble infections (e.g., fever, sweats - especially night sweats, weakness), but also one of the symptoms of hematological diseases, resulting from immune disorders, can be recurrent infections. Therefore, early diagnosis - crucial for the success of therapy - may be difficult,\" said the director of the Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine in Warsaw, Prof. Anna Kowalska.", "redacted": 1}

The doctor is nice and tries to be polite, but in my opinion, he still has too little experience and is not very thorough. He conducted the interview quite superficially. He tried to convince me that I was limping on my right leg, even though my left leg hurts and I limp on the left. In the documentation, he also wrote that the patient complains of pain in the right leg. What a mistake!", "redacted": 0}

After a 5-minute visit, an \"anal fissure\" was diagnosed, I received a prescription for an ointment and a call for a check-up in 3 weeks. And although initially the ointment helped a little, it wasn't for long. At the control visit (also 5 minutes long) I received the same instruction - continued use of the ointment. The problem stopped for a while, since then the pain has appeared from time to time, and since the beginning of this week it has become the same as at the beginning. My rating is neutral because the visits were very short, and Dr. Jan Kowalski himself, instead of giving me detailed information, referred me to knowledge on the internet. Additionally, Dr. Jan Kowalski was not very empathetic, and I, as a patient, did not feel \"well cared for medically.\"", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_001265", "lang": "en", "text": "The slogan \"Time is brain\" well captures the essence of the problem. The earlier the patient gets to a specialized stroke unit (there are about 150 of them in Poland), the better. As Prof. Anna Kowalska from the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology said, every lost 20 minutes significantly reduces the patient's chances of returning to full fitness. Imaging tests facilitate the localization of the stroke, while the administration of fibrinolytic drugs limits the extent of damage. However, it must be administered no later than 4.5 hours after the stroke occurs. Due to too late arrival at the hospital and numerous contraindications, the method can only be used in a few percent of patients. Stroke, as explained by Prof. Kowalska, in 80% of cases results from ischemia of part of the brain, in 15% - from hemorrhage due to rupture of an artery in the brain, and in 5% of cases it is subarachnoid hemorrhage.", "redacted": 2}

{"opinion_id": "op_001267", "lang": "en", "text": "The problem is that too high a dose of insulin not matched to the amount of food consumed and physical exertion can lead to a large drop in blood sugar, so-called hypoglycemia. \"It is hypoglycemia that athletes, parents, and of course doctors fear the most,\" emphasized Dr. Jan Kowalski. Hypoglycemia can manifest itself, among other things, by weakness, drowsiness, increased sweating, trembling hands, nausea, but also by a change in behavior and aggression. In an extreme situation and lack of help, it leads to coma, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and even death. \"The patient and his parents must be educated so that they can best prepare for physical exertion - e.g., consider reducing the insulin dose, or possibly consuming additional carbohydrates if the blood glucose value drops significantly. For this purpose, strict glycemic control after training is necessary, also at night, because hypoglycemia can also occur then,\" explained Dr. Jan Kowalski. According to him, this requires good cooperation between children and parents with a diabetologist doctor and great self-discipline.", "redacted": 2}
{"opinion_id": "op_001268", "lang": "en", "text": "Prof. Jan Kowalski emphasized that it is necessary to increase social awareness about the causes of skin cancers and the possibilities of their early detection. \"Thanks to this, many cases of advanced or metastatic skin cancer could be avoided,\" he noted. He reminded that the most important risk factor for these cancers, which we can influence, is the exposure of the skin to UV radiation - e.g., during sunbathing, using tanning beds, or working outdoors without sun protection. Furthermore, the standards of skin cancer prevention recommend examining one's own body once a month. \"If we do this regularly, we have a greater chance of detecting a worrying change,\" explained the specialist. If we observe one, we should go to a doctor, e.g., primary care or a dermatologist, who should refer the patient further.", "redacted": 1}

According to the scientist, it is extremely important for the sensors to be small and comfortable. \"In addition, we need to find the right place for them on the body, because they should not disturb, especially a small child,\" said Dr. Anna Kowalska. \"We want it to be cheap and easy-to-use equipment so that everyone can use it.

He patiently explained to me without imposing any of the methods, the course, results..., discussing what I can realistically expect from each. He was always kind, positive and professional. The procedure went perfectly, exactly as it was supposed to, I am very satisfied both with the expertise and the care before and after the procedure. I must also praise Dr. Jan Kowalski's entire team because the nursing care was also very good. NB: The first procedure did not take place because together with the anesthesiologist it was decided to abandon the operation due to poor blood results and a previously suffered throat infection. But I didn't have to schedule any next appointment immediately, I could even give up. Dr. Jan Kowalski said then: \"it must be safe first and then beautiful, and exactly in that order\".

To my question regarding gums and teeth, she answered: \"and what do you want from me with these teeth (she meant parents in general), I'm not going to poke around there\"?! To more serious questions regarding my child's health and questions regarding the vaccine, I heard - \"how should I know?\" To sum up, it's a waste of time and money for the visit.
