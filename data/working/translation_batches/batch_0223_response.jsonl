At first the child was afraid and wouldn't even get on the high rehabilitation table, now they do it without problem. Besides, they used to walk with a shuffling gait but the physiotherapist's exercises helped the child so much that now they step up and down alternately.

{"opinion_id": "op_004450", "lang": "en", "text": "A visit with this doctor through the National Health Fund is a total drama. She doesn't allow children to be transported in a bassinet, believes children should always be carried in a car seat. Claims that feeding a child pumpkin will prevent autism. Even questions speech therapists' opinions and believes one shouldn't massage the wound after frenotomy because \"you can always cut the frenulum again later.\" Generally heard many stupid things there. Don't recommend.... reading reviews here before the visit I thought the negative ones were exaggerated, but unfortunately I confirm the negative opinions.", "redacted": 0}

{"opinion_id": "op_004452", "lang": "en", "text": "Definitely not recommended. A National Health Fund visit in an atmosphere of rush, nerves, zero empathy, calmness, or observation of what's happening. The child should cry, sob intensely, get petechiae from crying - then it's good because it strengthens abdominal muscles. The half-hour visit took place entirely in screaming, sobbing etc. Our little boy cried like a cat, the doctor didn't react, just continued. Gave a whole list of problems diagnosed by her, thus questioning the work of numerous doctors. Generally gives the impression of someone who knows everything - better and more than doctors, and certainly more than parents. The next child after us was also sobbing so intensely they couldn't calm down - we and the entire corridor heard it. Those other negative reviews are 100% accurate - I endorse them...", "redacted": 0}

The doctor is the first physician who didn't tell me \"that's just how you are\" and wasn't frightened by the fact that I've already been through the most commonly prescribed medications, unsuccessfully.
