It would be best if my visit ended right after entering the office. Only after my persistent questions about whether we could do something today since I visited the office, I was offered scaling and other maintenance procedures, during which it turned out that there is actually one tooth that requires serious treatment. When I asked if there was anything else to do, I was told that everything is okay and requires no intervention and that I should come back in six months. Now another doctor (also Luxmed) has listed several more teeth that need attention. It's hard for me to interpret this as anything other than reluctance to care for a subscription customer. Probably Pani Marzena is a great specialist, as the service was performed very well, but the fact that for half a year I lived with the awareness that my teeth were in good condition really irritated me.", "redacted": 1}

After a longer absence from the office, I decided on anesthesia even though I am very afraid of needles. The suggestion to close my eyes was a relief, and thanks to the gentleness and sensitivity of Pani Marzena, I didn't even feel the moment the needle went in.

To summarize, Pani Doktor is a surgeon of the first specialization who takes her work very seriously and I will definitely book my next appointment with her. I RECOMMEND", "redacted": 1}

I hadn't been to a dentist for several years because fear wouldn't let me, I was saving money for anesthesia and getting all my teeth done at once. In the meantime, I got pregnant and in the 18th week, one of the decayed teeth started hurting so I went to the dentist. The mere thought that I had to go there was terrifying, but the horror only began in the office; the lady doctor made me feel like dirt, asking how one could neglect their teeth so much, etc., she criticized me throughout the entire visit, and with such behavior, she intensified my fear of the dentist even more. I couldn't recover all day, cried a lot, and I think her attitude harmed my child and me worse than that sick tooth. I never want to see her again and I certainly won't visit that clinic again. I hope I find a more tactful and gentle dentist who will help me.", "redacted": 0}

All the opinions below are correct. I ended up with the doctor by accident after reading positive reviews of a doctor with the same name who also practices in Wroclaw. The doctor was very indelicate, very rushed. She stretched my mouth in such an unpleasant way that I felt pain after the visit. Drilling the teeth was also very unpleasant and indelicate. After getting up from the chair, I felt dizzy. The worst dentist. This happened at Fabryczna 6 in Luxmed. I also filed a complaint with Luxmed because it's a scandal that such a doctor sees patients.

The assistant was doing something by the drawers, whereas with other Luxmed doctors, they are non-stop with the patient. I never before had such a feeling that a dentist was jamming their fingers into my chin and face. Anesthesia administered not gently, and towards the end of the visit, it started wearing off.

All these stories about lying head down, lack of assistance, not using a suction are unfortunately true. Very strong pressing of the head into the chair, as well as the gauze in the mouth.

During the visit itself, I was choking on my own saliva, which shouldn't surprise anyone, since firstly, you are in a lying position the whole procedure, and secondly, the suction is an unnecessary tool for Pani dentist... similarly, by the way, to the assistance of the assistant during the removal of the old amalgam (unthinkable with other dentists!) - guaranteed flying pieces of the old filling around the face and falling into the throat. Lack of gentleness and comfort during the visit, the pace, and the lingering post-visit ailments mean I will definitely not return, and I will advise everyone else against a visit with Dr. Jankowska.

I read other opinions and have been to other dentists since then, about whom it was written that they are very nice, that the atmosphere in the office is wonderful, but it's precisely with such ones that I've had complaints before - so what if they're nice if none of them are professionals?

{"opinion_id": "op_004439", "lang": "en", "text": "I am at the beginning of my 5th month of pregnancy. I was with Dr. Jankowska for fillings on two teeth. This was one of my worse visits at Luxmed (Fabryczna). The doctor knew what state I was in, that I was pregnant, and for almost 35 minutes I lay head down and choked on saliva and tooth fragments, not once was I given a chance to rinse my mouth, to close my mouth even for a moment. The anesthesia I received was painful compared to a previous visit with another doctor. The anesthesia lasted for about 4 hours, during which I wasn't even able to drink water, let alone eat, whereas compared to the previous visit with another doctor, it certainly wasn't like that. Additionally, while applying the filling and holding the tooth with a metal insert, Pani Dr. Jankowska caught her gown on that screw, injuring my lip in the process, which was terribly unpleasant. Furthermore, I constantly felt like the doctor was sitting on my head; after leaving the office, my head looked like after an all-night sleep. Overall, I will not recommend Pani Dr. to friends but rather advise against. The worst dentist visit.", "redacted": 1}
