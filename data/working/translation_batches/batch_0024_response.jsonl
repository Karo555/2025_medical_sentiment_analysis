So far, about 120 of them have been studied. We already know that some of them can be successfully used to support the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, various types of injuries, and even neurological diseases. Moreover, there is no problem with their application – you just need to attach the little animal to the appropriate place on the patient's body,\" explained Anna Kowalska. As Dr. Jan Kowalski admitted, although the scientists were trained in animal breeding, they were not immune to mistakes in care. \"A leech reaches reproductive capability after three years of life; to be safely used in treatment, it should be properly bred and fed all the time, and this requires knowledge and work. We have been operating for 12 years and are probably still the only medicinal leech breeding farm in Poland that meets all formal requirements. Unfortunately, it still happens that leech suppliers take shortcuts and trade animals of unknown origin, often exposing unaware users to unpleasant surprises and the environment to serious losses. It's a shame, because we would gladly share our knowledge with those willing to establish new breeding farms,\" said Anna Kowalska.", "redacted": 2}

I am only 38 years old and I couldn't walk due to spinal insufficiency. Dr. Jan Kowalski operated on me completely by chance because from the queue and he really had a lot of problems during the operation - broken spinal blood vessels, removal of a disc and insertion of a titanium implant - he handled it excellently. Now, almost 3 months after the operation, I almost forget that my spine used to hurt. That's not all, I spent about a week in the Białystok neurosurgery department and I'll just say that only this doctor during the night shift spends almost the whole night with suffering patients. He talks, prescribes medications, orders further urgent procedures to relieve the patient's suffering. I didn't see any of the other neurosurgeons voluntarily spending the night shift among patients in their department. The remaining \"doctors\" are money-grabbing businessmen, not doctors with a calling. They sleep somewhere in rooms and order procedures to nurses from a distance, not appearing on the department at night. I know this well because I didn't sleep many nights there due to pain and I saw what was happening. Dr. Jan Kowalski is a great doctor, always cheerful and a nice person, the best specialist I have ever met. He never leaves a patient in need.", "redacted": 2}

Nice, concrete, willingly answered my questions, sometimes threw in a joke. He is not cheap, but I know from experience that good doctors value themselves. He is not overly modest (but I am used to it because I went to an allergist who also liked to boast - quite rightly - because she got me out of severe ailments). I don't know how it will be later and what the treatment effects will be. In any case, he said \"Don't worry, you will have a child, we just need to get your health in order.\" He gave me his mobile phone number and said that he is always available by phone and will answer questions if I don't know something. The only thing that worried me was that he didn't set up a file for me. He didn't write anything down, etc. He only carefully reviewed my tests (and there were many of them) and told me what and how. However, he didn't record anything for himself. He scheduled the next visit quite quickly, again with an ultrasound, but with my condition, you can't see the effects otherwise. For now, apart from changing medications and the next visit, he didn't order anything for me. He only announced what else awaits me. I'll see how it goes and I'll speak up again, maybe even give a rating. P.S. My friend was with him once because she thought she was pregnant (without having intercourse basically - when she told me what and how, I partly understand him), he apparently joked with her.

Bacteria from the Ga. xylinus group are its most efficient producers. This bacterium in nature inhabits some food products, especially fruits, appears in the process of pickling cucumbers, and in the Far East it is used for the natural production of various types of biofilms, i.e., membranes built from polysaccharides.
