{"opinion_id": "op_004447", "text": "We've been going to rehabilitation for two years now and the progress is amazing. At first the child was afraid and wouldn't even get on the high rehabilitation table, now they do it without problem. Besides, they used to walk with a shuffling gait but the physiotherapist's exercises helped the child so much that now they step up and down alternately. We're very grateful to the physiotherapist.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004448", "text": "My little Daniel at 6 months had low muscle tone - Anna perfected his condition with full professional support for us - the parents. Now she's treating our little daughter Mia - I recommend for many reasons. It's not just professionalism, but also kind and committed support and advice. Highly recommended.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004449", "text": "We've been using Anna's rehabilitation services for about 13 years, I believe she's the best specialist, with huge knowledge, hard work from the child but visible results show enormous commitment. She's very warm, 100% engaged for her patients, the best physiotherapist in Czestochowa because she always puts the patient's well-being first.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004450", "text": "A visit with this doctor through the National Health Fund is a total drama. She doesn't allow children to be transported in a bassinet, believes children should always be carried in a car seat. Claims that feeding a child pumpkin will prevent autism. Even questions speech therapists' opinions and believes one shouldn't massage the wound after frenotomy because \"you can always cut the frenulum again later.\" Generally heard many stupid things there. Don't recommend.... reading reviews here before the visit I thought the negative ones were exaggerated, but unfortunately I confirm the negative opinions.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004451", "text": "Very extensive knowledge and professionalism, friendly approach to both child and parent. Progress after sessions is visible to the naked eye.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004452", "text": "Definitely not recommended. A National Health Fund visit in an atmosphere of rush, nerves, zero empathy, calmness, or observation of what's happening. The child should cry, sob intensely, get petechiae from crying - then it's good because it strengthens abdominal muscles. The half-hour visit took place entirely in screaming, sobbing etc. Our little boy cried like a cat, the doctor didn't react, just continued. Gave a whole list of problems diagnosed by her, thus questioning the work of numerous doctors. Generally gives the impression of someone who knows everything - better and more than doctors, and certainly more than parents. The next child after us was also sobbing so intensely they couldn't calm down - we and the entire corridor heard it. Those other negative reviews are 100% accurate - I endorse them...", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004453", "text": "I recommend Anna because she's a professional through and through. We attended sessions with our son for half a year. Sure, there was some crying, but the rehabilitation results were visible practically after every session. She's a person with enormous knowledge and experience. In a friendly way she can advise and tell concerned parents what to do and where to go with their child. Thank you and recommend.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004454", "text": "Probably the only specialist in Czestochowa who can be recommended for small children and newborns. Both my children had abnormal muscle tone. My son is 3 years old today and has absolutely no deficits related to this, runs jumps goes wild like any child his age. My little daughter is 6 months old now and is undergoing physiotherapy and loves meetings with Anna. Progress is visible practically after every visit. During the visit parents also get exhaustive answers to their questions.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_004457", "text": "The worst dermatologist I've ever encountered. If someone is looking for the cause I absolutely don't recommend, the best solution according to the doctor is ###### and ######. Hormonal problems, other illnesses? No way! Avoid at all costs!", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004458", "text": "I visited the doctor today with hormonal acne problems. The doctor is the first physician who didn't tell me \"that's just how you are\" and wasn't frightened by the fact that I've already been through the most commonly prescribed medications, unsuccessfully. I was listened to, was prescribed appropriate tests and a comprehensive treatment plan was made i.e. several different products, not just one cream or retinoid. The doctor calmly (despite the appointment delay there was no sense of time pressure) explained all options. Highly recommend!", "lang": "en"}
