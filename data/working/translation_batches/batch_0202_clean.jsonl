{"opinion_id": "op_004031", "text": "I have been going to Anna for physiotherapy for 3 years now. She is a physiotherapist with great knowledge and commitment, in her office you can relax in a pleasant atmosphere and even talk and laugh. I have used the help of various physiotherapists but only here for the first time I encountered such commitment and knowledge. Anna helped me when I had sciatica and even steroid injections did not help me. After a series of treatments, she got me back on my feet and I could walk and function normally without pain. Often when I have migraines or shoulder pain, I come for rehabilitation because I know she will always help me and I will feel better and be healthy.", "lang": "en"}
