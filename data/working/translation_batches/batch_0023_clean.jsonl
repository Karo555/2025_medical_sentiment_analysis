{"opinion_id": "op_000442", "text": "I strongly advise against. I confirm what other women have written - scaring with infertility, ordering dozens of tests, the price of which I only found out when it came time to pay for the visit (the doctor took two tubes of blood, and then it turned out he ordered 20 tests from it, without asking absolutely beforehand if I could afford it). When I once questioned the need to perform some tests because I had already done them (e.g., blood type - I have been an honorary blood donor for many years and my blood type is the same every time :)), he stated that some mistake could have occurred, which of course has mortal consequences for my health. On a side note, I hope the blood donation center didn't kill anyone with my blood of a supposedly mistaken type. Ad. treatment - after 2 months of visits (unfortunately, I only realized after two months that I probably couldn't be that ill) and consuming two courses of antibiotics (I'm not even sure if they were for the bacteria I actually had in my vagina), I was so depleted and without immunity that I constantly caught colds and picked up various bugs for the next year. Dr. Jan Kowalski effectively discouraged me from infertility treatment. After one of the subsequent visits (this time with my spouse, who turned pale when he saw that I wasn't exaggerating about the visit possibly costing 1000 PLN) I told my husband that the treatment was over. I will never in my life agree to IVF (and not for religious reasons) and I certainly have no intention of visiting another star gynecologist who will prey on my naivety, ignorance and induce constant stress that if I overlook something, I have no chance of having a child. The result - as I wrote earlier - about a year of rebuilding immunity (with a healthy diet and a calmer lifestyle), and for eight months, visits to an NHS gynecologist who with great competence and patience is managing my (!) uncomplicated pregnancy.", "lang": "en"}

Taste is the most important factor that determines our food choices. The team in which Dr. Anna Kowalska works therefore wants to replace the fat contained in food products with a gel, but of a type that will give the taste and characteristic texture of fat. Such a gel \"fat\" would allow for real calorie savings. Its caloric value would be close to zero, while real fat provides us with about 9 kcal per 1 gram of product. \"We want to make processed products healthier and less caloric, but we also try to ensure that the taste, consistency and appearance of the product do not suffer.

I went to the doctor for 1.5 years, during which for a year we were trying for a child, unsuccessfully. The Doctor began training in infertility treatment and unfortunately I can describe my case as a result of her failed experiments. Knowing that I have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the Doctor prescribed me lutein from the 16th day of the cycle, which, as I found out from a Professor at the Invicta clinic, acts as a contraceptive in my case...

{"opinion_id": "op_000447", "text": "Hello everyone. I don't feel qualified to judge the entirety of the doctor's career, only my experiences with him. In March, I had knee arthroscopy after a sprain and during this procedure, a resection of the medial meniscus cartilage. Apparently the resection was minimal but 2 months without loading the limb. Rehabilitation gave no effect. The doctor of course claimed that everything was ok and suggested that I probably wasn't applying myself to the rehabilitation. Now I have been to see Dr. Jan Kowalski and had an MRI. The result - two foreign bodies in the knee, bone marrow inflammation and an irregular cartilage edge. So my rating of this doctor is very poor. Maybe he helped other people, but he harmed me by not referring me for an MRI (from him) and insisting on the further necessity of rehabilitation.

She gives very interesting exercises. Anna Kowalska follows the patient, and sometimes steers the conversation onto a different path, but usually an accurate one. Sometimes she can hit such a chord that I leave feeling cleansed and with a lighter soul. A revelation. She helped me a lot to discover myself. The only reservation is that sometimes you had to wait for your turn because the previous session ran over or suddenly you had to reschedule the visit, which could sometimes disrupt the day's plan. But this also has its good sides, because there was no problem if I myself rescheduled or was late. I highly recommend Anna Kowalska!", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_000450", "text": "I have mixed feelings about the visit to the Doctor. It was my first time with this lady, though it wasn't my first time with a gynecologist. I wanted a check-up, I know I have an ectropion but the Doctor did not comment on it at all during the examination. The examination went very quickly and I understand that, but her statements were rather laconic. What surprised me the most was that the Doctor refused to perform a breast exam on me. I have been to many doctors and no gynecologist has ever refused me this. Some include it in the price, others perform such an examination for a fee. During a gynecological visit, I always ask for it and it seemed to me that nowadays this is standard. Especially since there is so much talk about it. I was only interested in prophylaxis, and the Doctor referred me to a radiologist! Out of curiosity, I later called 5 other gynecological offices to ask if, at the patient's request, they perform breast exams - every office confirmed that yes, they do. The Doctor's explanations and justifications for why she does not perform such examinations were very vague. I don't think I'll be back here.", "lang": "en"}

At first, I thought he was a good doctor, but over time I became convinced that he is just another doctor who \"goes for the quantity of patients, not the quality of treatment\". Perhaps the result of not caring for patients is the number of places he works, which is why he gets so lost. I have the impression that currently he is only interested in the money he gets for each patient and in having them leave his office as quickly as possible.

{"opinion_id": "op_000452", "text": "I have several serious reservations about the visit. Firstly, the Doctor did not focus on listening to me, so the conversation was chaotic and I had to repeat the same things several times; moreover, the answers were not precise and did not resolve my doubts (e.g., there was no question about the reason for the visit from the Doctor, everything was revealed out of order, and to the question about alternatives to birth control pills, I did not get an answer, just the name of other \"hormones\"). Secondly, the basic examination performed hurt me very much (to the point that I cried out in pain). Thirdly, I was prescribed an intravaginal medication to which I was apparently allergic and for 5 days I suffered from a doubling of the disease's symptoms (terrible itching) - I don't blame the Doctor for the allergy, but I believe she should have recommended that I check if I am allergic, as this was a medication that maintained its effect for 5 days after one application, meaning I had no possibility to stop using it (I should add that it was a rather expensive medication, about 40 PLN). There are still good sides to the visit, namely, learning how to perform a breast self-exam (this is the first of my 5 gynecologists who explained the method without me having to ask).", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_000455", "text": "In European Union countries, about 900,000 hernia operations are performed annually. Treatment involves returning the contents of the hernia sac to the peritoneal cavity. This stage is common to all types of hernia operations. Differences occur in the method of repair, i.e., simply closing the so-called hernia gate. There are two basic types of hernia repair â€“ tension repair using the patient's own tissues, and tension-free repair using hernia meshes of various shapes and made of different materials. Most often, a hernia is treated by sewing a surgical mesh made of polypropylene in the shape of a racket or a foot into the weakened tissue. On such a scaffold, the weakened part of the body can regenerate. Progress in the treatment of this type of condition involves limiting extensive operations in favor of procedures performed laparoscopically. During an operation performed with a minimal incision, a rolled-up mesh is inserted and unfolded inside the patient's body.", "lang": "en"}
