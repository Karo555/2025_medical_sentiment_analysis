When I asked for what purpose, if there was any indication, he backtracked on that proposal and said that basically it doesn't need to be done: ? ? I don't know what to think.

{"opinion_id": "op_000782", "text": "Even in pregnant women, sleep disturbances in the third trimester can promote changes in the fetal body that after birth increase the tendency to overweight and obesity, as well as metabolic disorders and diabetes. Dr. David Gozal from the pediatrics clinic at the University of Chicago demonstrated this in mice, but claims it could be similar in humans. His research shows that sleep disturbances during pregnancy inhibit the expression of the gene encoding adiponectin, a hormone influencing many metabolic processes, especially those related to glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Therefore, the more of it in the body, the better, as it protects against obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_000784", "text": "At the beginning of August 2014, I was operated on by Prof. Jan Kowalski at CMS. He removed sequestra from the L4/L5 and L5/S1 levels. The surgery proceeded successfully and without complications. The doctor is a professional with long-term experience in this type of procedure. He has a phenomenal approach to the patient, devotes a lot of attention during pre-operative consultations, explaining the nature of the condition, analyzing the MRI in detail, symptoms, and answering all questions. Before undergoing the surgery, I also consulted at other private clinics in Warsaw, and I decided to put myself in the hands of Prof. Jan Kowalski partly because the patient stays in the hospital for 4-5 days after the procedure and is under the strict supervision of the professor. If all available conservative methods don't bring results and you have, like me, neurological symptoms of discopathy and surgery is the only way out, you can trust Dr. Jan Kowalski without worry.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_000787", "text": "According to Jan Kowalski, performing genetic tests is not a waste of money, as it allows avoiding unnecessary treatment of the patient with an expensive targeted drug or saving on not always cheap chemotherapy and the treatment of its complications. Targeted therapy not only prolongs patient survival but is usually better tolerated than chemotherapy. Studies show, for example, that the quality of life of patients treated with crizotinib is much better than that of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Experts emphasized that in Poland there is a problem with funding genetic tests, e.g., in patients with lung cancer. The National Health Fund wants to refund money only for tests performed on those patients in whom a genetic change is detected. As Jan Kowalski explained, this means that for 100 patients tested for mutations in the EGFR gene, the fund will pay only for the 10 in whom it is found. The cost of one such test is from 300 to 500 PLN, so it is completely unprofitable for hospitals.", "lang": "en"}

Mr. Jan Kowalski advised me to stop taking the medication because it's expensive and in Western Europe they don't treat elevated prolactin. He advised me to see how I would feel without taking medication for hyperprolactinemia. I was very surprised by such a completely different opinion, so I decided to listen to Mr. Jan Kowalski. I thought he might be right. The prolactin level increased significantly and I felt bad. I had to start therapy from scratch and thanks to another really good endocrinologist, I now have everything under control. The question is, is Mr. Jan Kowalski a good doctor? I doubt it.", "lang": "en"}

Equally important is the simplicity of the examinations. On the patient's head, it is enough to place a cap with optical fibers attached to it and inject the patient with a small dose of contrast agent. The examination itself lasts only a few minutes and can be repeated multiple times during the day.

I am devastated by what he did to me; my nose looks terrible, and if I had known that these would be the results of the surgery, I would never have undergone it in my life!!!! The worst thing is that during visits he tried to convince me that the nose is beautiful and I breathe well, it just seems to me that I breathe poorly.
