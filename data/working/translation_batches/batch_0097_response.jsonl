The doctor seems hard of hearing, doesn't respond to the parent's suggestions—for example, that maybe instead of suppositories, an antipyretic syrup—says her piece, collects the money, and leaves. She may have experience and practice, but her approach to the little patient and their parent is worth nothing. I do not recommend.", "redacted": 1}

I've been trying to get pregnant for over a year; I went for a visit to ask what I could do. When the doctor heard I had trouble getting pregnant, she jumped on me, told me I chose the wrong place, that Enel-Med doesn't deal with infertility treatment. She said it in such a way that I completely broke down. I know she deals with this because she is also an endocrinologist. She suggested she could help me privately. How can you attack a woman who is going through such a tragedy? The situation is difficult, and she crushed me even more. She is a woman; I thought she would advise me something. I intended to go to her privately, but after such behavior, I'll probably choose another doctor. In my situation, I need a doctor who understands me, not someone who treats me like a nuisance.

Once in Poland, 20% of cases of this disease were detected through peripheral blood morphology performed routinely as part of periodic occupational medicine examinations; now it's only 2%. Statistics show, however, that in other European countries, this test detects up to 40% of all leukemia cases—noted Prof. Jan Kowalski. \"The role of occupational medicine in early disease diagnosis is invaluable. Often, it's the only moment over several years when we perform any examination. Occupational medicine, besides its primary role of determining the ability to perform a given job, is also an encouragement to monitor one's health status, a chance for earlier detection of potential diseases.

The first visit went correctly; the doctor referred me for a Baron procedure, even accommodating me with a quick appointment. Unfortunately, the second visit resembled a race against time rather than a procedure. From entry, straight to the chair, without a word, in half a minute the procedure was over, and I could get dressed. I hadn't even fastened my pants properly when the doctor, handing me a note with the next appointment date, showed me the door. At the threshold, I asked what the purpose of the next visit was. The doctor informed me that this procedure would need to be repeated, as the Baron method is done several times, which I had no idea about, and to this day it seems contradictory to information online. I quickly asked if there would be any pain, as I already wasn't feeling well, to which the doctor assured me everything would be fine and see you! The door closed behind me. I somehow made it to the reception, but to the car with difficulty. I lay in the car for 15 minutes crying from pain. I wondered how I was supposed to drive the car in such a state. It wasn't possible. The pain resembled falling on the tailbone from a great height combined with constipation. I returned to the clinic. Thank you to the receptionist who, as soon as she saw me, ran for the doctor. In the office, the doctor, without explaining, inserted a finger into the anus, removing the rubber band, and the pain subsided. Again, I received a note with an earlier appointment date, without explanation of what went wrong or what next. I had to ask a lot. The doctor said he would do it more gently knowing I'm so sensitive and would do so at the next visit. Of course, I'm not going back there again. From the knowledge I gathered, such pain can be caused by a poorly applied rubber band, and moreover, such a band is very hard to remove, so I have doubts about what procedure the doctor actually performed.", "redacted": 0}

In the healing process, these temperatures equalize. However, knowing the value of this temperature difference enables primarily the diagnosis of the burn itself,\" she says. A first-degree burn is not dangerous; a cold compress is enough. With a third-degree burn, the matter is also clear because tissue charring occurs, and there aren't many treatment options. But doctors have the biggest problem with second-degree burns. \"In this case, the doctor must decide whether the tissue should be surgically excised or treated. The ability to distinguish the degree of burn in this case is key in deciding how much tissue can be saved,\" explains the researcher. IR Diagnostics can serve not only for diagnosing burn wounds but also for imaging the healing of other difficult and extensive wounds, e.g., diabetic wounds, where we also deal with a temperature difference.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_001938", "lang": "en", "text": "One of the currently researched and developed strategies to fight trypanosomes focuses on blocking the folate metabolism in these parasites. Both human cells and parasite cells need folic acid for growth. Interestingly, blocking the so-called folate pathway is one of the mechanisms of action of currently used anticancer drugs, such as methotrexate. Instead of creating completely new drugs against trypanosomes, the possibility of optimizing existing drugs to block the folate pathway of these parasites has recently been considered. Such an approach gives a chance to accelerate the drug development process—says Dr. Anna Kowalska. However, she notes that the metabolism of trypanosomes differs from human metabolism. A protein designated PTR1 causes the parasites to be resistant to drugs like methotrexate. Scientists have attempted to inhibit the activity of this protein, but there is still a lack of knowledge to do this efficiently. It is not known, among other things, how different fragments of this protein molecule move relative to each other. Dynamics are very important for the function of enzymes like PTR1. Therefore, Dr. Anna Kowalska is studying the dynamics of the troublesome protein to make it easier to block in the future.", "redacted": 1}
