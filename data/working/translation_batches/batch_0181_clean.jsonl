{"opinion_id": "op_003608", "text": "I DO NOT RECOMMEND!! I made an appointment with Dr. Anna Kowalska because almost a month of treatment by an internist for sinuses and throat did not yield results. I received an antibiotic that turned out not to be suitable for sinuses, and a recommendation not to sleep on my stomach without any basis. How do I know? I had a follow-up with another doctor who laughed at the ban on sleeping on the stomach - he had never heard of such a thing. And the internist and another ENT specialist stated that the antibiotic was not suitable for sinuses. A waste of time, money, and nerves. Maybe the diagnosis was okay but the treatment was a failure.", "lang": "en"}
