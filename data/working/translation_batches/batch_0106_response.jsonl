{"opinion_id": "op_002103", "lang": "en", "text": "Optical methods for monitoring the brain utilize the fact that light can penetrate the skull bones to some extent. This especially concerns light from the near-infrared range, with wavelengths between 650 and 850 nanometers (a nanometer is one-millionth of a millimeter). The properties of blood are of significant importance here - specifically hemoglobin, whose oxygenated form interacts with light differently than the reduced form. This phenomenon allows assessing the oxygenation level of the observed body part by analyzing the intensity of light penetrating the tissue. The basic elements of optical diagnostic devices are small light sources (laser diodes) and sensitive photodetectors. The sources and detectors, usually spaced 2-5 cm apart, are paired together. Several to over a dozen such pairs can be applied to the patient's head simultaneously, potentially allowing examination of a significant part of the brain.", "redacted": 0}
