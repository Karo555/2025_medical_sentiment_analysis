{"opinion_id": "op_000961", "lang": "en", "text": "According to the specialist, this is most visible in the case of stomach cancer, one of the most malignant tumors. The decline in incidence of this cancer clearly coincides with the period when some Poles changed their diet to a healthier one. For example, between 1960 and 2005, fruit consumption in our country increased by 2.5 times, and vegetables by 41%. Meanwhile, salt consumption - which is one of the main risk factors for stomach cancer - decreased by 26% between 1999 and 2011. As specialists reminded, salt reduces the thickness of the protective stomach mucosa - and when it is thinner, the Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which increases the risk of cancer in this organ, more easily takes hold.", "redacted": 0}

He has a lot of respect and patience for patients. He listens, explains what's needed, answers every question. Nice and polite, with a sense of humor. An outstanding surgeon. Thanks to Him, I still have both breasts. In the emergency room, another doctor informed me that I would have a breast amputation. Fortunately, that didn't happen. Dr. Jan Kowalski performed a breast-conserving surgery. I am very grateful to Him for that. Three months have passed since the surgery. There were no complications. The wound healed nicely. I am full of admiration and appreciation for Dr. Jan Kowalski. I have great trust in Him. He is truly a wonderful doctor. Anna", "redacted": 2}

The doctor examined the eye for a long time, that's a fact. She even thought one of the devices was broken and examined again on another. She suspected me of having astigmatism, but ultimately ruled it out. She wrote a prescription for glasses with a strong lens for the right eye (+2.25). I filled the prescription and it turned out that you can't see through these glasses!!! They are terrible, it even 'hurts' when you try to wait 'for your eyes to adjust'. I returned to the clinic but at the reception I learned that this lady no longer works here... I wasted 450 + 90 zł because of her (glasses with good lenses + replacement of the right lens for glasses I already had) and I still have no idea what's wrong with my one eye. This lady couldn't assess it, didn't find the cause. And she didn't even suggest other tests or a visit to someone with more experience (normal practice among respectable doctors when they encounter a difficult case). I warn against this doctor. She is not a professional.", "redacted": 0}

First I went to Sokołów Podlaski where doctors did an MRI and it turned out I have a very large hernia pressing on the spinal cord, my right arm was becoming paralyzed.

Thanks to my great luck, I ended up in the hands of Dr. Jan Kowalski who operated on me very quickly, 4 hours later I started walking, nothing hurts, the scar is almost invisible.

But... firstly, I don't think blaming a parent for their child being sick is appropriate, secondly, prescribing a ton of medications, including permanent nasal steroids, I don't consider a beneficial health solution without understanding the reasons why the little one gets sick, thirdly, diseases like bronchitis or ear infections are childhood diseases anyway and the Doctor's assessment that the son is too young for such illnesses is completely inconsistent with pediatricians' assessments.

Despite this, the doctor prescribed me 'eye relaxing' drops. The headaches temporarily went away and I thought it was thanks to the drops, but it was a coincidence, the drops didn't work long-term. I returned to the doctor in the meantime for another prescription, she examined me again (I don't know why, since nothing probably changed in a month or two), she explained that she couldn't take money from me for just writing a prescription, so the question is, why did she take it at all, for me being re-examined was just as unnecessary spending money as paying for just the prescription. Earlier I thought I had been thoroughly examined, but when I went for an examination to another ophthalmologist, my eyes were dilated there for a better examination, the doctor never did that. Besides, from the opinion of the second ophthalmologist I learned that I shouldn't use the drops that were prescribed to me if no eye defect was found.

The Doctor certainly has enormous experience, but we are opposed to buying full bags of medications at the pharmacy every few days. Later our son started to be treated homeopathically, all symptoms of any diseases he had disappeared. The allergy, alleged asthma, and other health disturbances disappeared. He hasn't consumed any medications for many years except homeopathy. He is healthy as a fish.

I didn't learn anything at the visit, no path or direction in solving the problem - she said she would consult and let me know - but I never heard from her again.

Earlier I was skeptical about homeopathy and for 2 years I carried the phone number in my pocket. My son was premature and from a young age he suffered from bronchitis turning into pneumonia. I took him to a pediatrician who gave him 2 antibiotics a month, he went to kindergarten from age 5 - one week in kindergarten - two weeks sick and so on in a circle. He hardly went to kindergarten at all due to constant infections, I was afraid he wouldn't manage in 1st grade. The pediatrician told me that she couldn't help him, suggested hospital. The allergist doctor only inhalers, Zyrtec and zero improvement. I said enough - and made an appointment for the first visit at the Homeopathy Institute, where I ended up with Anna. It was May 2005. Since then my son hasn't taken antibiotics, which doesn't mean he never got sick. We stopped all traditional medications, he only takes homeopathic ones and finally we live normally. How happy we were when in winter I could go sledding with my healthy son. I am enormously grateful to the doctor for being there and so selflessly helping little patients. Thanks to her my now 11-year-old Jan functions normally, goes to school and achieves very good academic results (at the end of 4th grade a certificate with honors).

The degree of doctor is obtained by writing a doctoral thesis which every doctor after completing medical studies has several years to do it is in no way related to the doctor's skills. I have very bad experiences with Ms. Anna Kowalska precisely from Karowa where she works under the supervision of Prof. Jan Kowalski. The fact of the number of 'I do not recommend' comments under the opinions speaks for itself. She is a young doctor so there is a chance she will work on her attitude.", "redacted": 3}
