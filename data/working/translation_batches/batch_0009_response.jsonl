I had an appointment with the doctor yesterday, and a regular visit turned out to be extraordinary! It was probably the first time in my life that I felt someone truly wanted to listen to me and help. The doctor gave me as much time as needed, didn't rush anything, and every detail was important. I'm going for a check-up in a month. I already know this will be my doctor! Best regards, a satisfied patient Anna Kowalska.", "redacted": 2}

During the procedure, he didn't even ask if I was okay. After leaving the office, I felt faint. I went to the toilet where I noticed that the procedure caused bleeding. I wasn't prepared for that either. So my first-ever visit to a proctologist turned out to be rather traumatic.", "redacted": 0}

Extremely nice, polite, competent, humble in the face of what life throws at us... uplifting us parents... in many cases very desperate... afraid of what will happen next... yet able to make the right decision and comfort us.

He looked at miniature MRI images because he didn't even know how to enlarge them - and claimed that's the best way to see. When I asked detailed questions, I was dismissed - of course, in a very nice way - when I insisted on more specific answers, there was so-called \"beating around the bush\" and changing the subject. According to this doctor, there are certain treatment protocols that MUST help in every situation, and if the patient is still sick, it means they're pretending and there's no other explanation because it HAD TO HELP. Personally, he didn't help me at all, quite the opposite.", "redacted": 0}

It was very difficult because the man had previously undergone surgery for this reason - at that time, a so-called gastrointestinal bypass was performed, after which many adhesions remained in the peritoneal cavity. \"By removing the patient's pancreas, we induce type 1 diabetes, which requires insulin administration. To avoid this, we immediately isolated pancreatic islets from the removed organ and implanted them under the patient's gastric mucosa. It was thus an autotransplantation, which is beneficial because it doesn't risk transplant rejection and doesn't require immunosuppressive drugs,\" explained Prof. Jan Kowalski.", "redacted": 1}

There is scientific data indicating that the presence of this protein indicates the development of Alzheimer's disease. We didn't stop there; we will search for more markers and develop sensors for their detection. These studies must be closely linked with medical institutions because analyzing the blood of patients affected by the disease and continuously searching for the reasons that lead to it will give us a tool in the form of new markers - emphasized Prof. Anna Kowalska. \"If we manage to develop such a test, and everything is on the right track, it would be an extremely helpful tool for the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's. There is great expectation from their side; the families of patients live in anxiety whether, 'if a loved one is affected by this disease, does that mean the same fate awaits me?'.

{"opinion_id": "op_000169", "lang": "en", "text": "The radiation dose and the moment when it can be applied are crucial in the fight against cancers. Whether the moment is right or not is determined by, among other things, partial oxygen pressure, which can be understood as oxygen concentration. This parameter changes throughout the day and depends on many factors. Thanks to such information, doctors know that radiation will destroy the tumor and not healthy cells. They can adjust therapy doses, making it less painful, more personalized, and with fewer side effects. Diagnostics aim to irradiate tumors exactly when oxygen intensity is highest. Animal studies confirm this possibility. This is significant in brain tumors, eye tumors, or in small organs in children.", "redacted": 0}

He spends time with the patient; the visit isn't \"rushed,\" but in my opinion, he could explain a bit more to the patient how to deal with the health problem, how to prevent it, etc., and not just refer for further tests. It was the first visit, so I can't comment on treatment effects. The ultrasound examination is included in the visit price.", "redacted": 0}

It is known that their elevated level in the blood is a factor indicating a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. \"Although these were young and completely healthy individuals, in whom the risk of cardiovascular diseases is not yet considered, we found elevated blood pressure in boys living in Krakow compared to their peers from Lublin,\" said Dr. Jan Kowalski, who presented the study results at the congress.

It turns out that the need to take care of oneself is often dependent on being in a relationship. This concerns not only health but also hygiene. An intimate relationship motivates more to maintain it.\"", "redacted": 2}

The new building has so-called high-fidelity simulation rooms, including one imitating a hospital emergency department, intensive care, an operating block, and a delivery room. There will also be an ambulance simulator used for rescue exercises. The opening of the simulation center will allow for modern education of students from the faculties comprising the Collegium Medicum. Before their first contact with a real patient, they will be able to practice all medical procedures on phantoms and simulators that recreate situations and conditions close to real ones.

Prof. Solange Peters from Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne pointed out that the application of molecularly targeted therapies in lung cancer patients is complicated by the fact that the cells of this tumor, like melanoma cells, have significantly more somatic mutations (i.e., arising in body cells, not inherited - PAP) - on average about 200 - than are found in the cells of other malignant tumors.", "redacted": 0}
