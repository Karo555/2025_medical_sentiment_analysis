{"opinion_id": "op_003758", "text": "The worst investment of 250 z≈Ç. I registered with the doctor because she had available appointments and good reviews. I came with lower back pain, an X-ray, and shooting pains in my fingers suggesting nerve issues. The doctor performed a standard neurological test but ignored my complaints. When asked what to do, she said I could take painkillers and she would gladly prescribe them. When I asked about exercises, she brought a photocopy with general recommendations and advised looking for paid rehabilitation. She stated I could come every two months but did not explain why. I was concerned by her warning that if 'my leg starts to go numb,' I should return immediately, but she did not explain what that meant. For insomnia issues, she proposed compounded medications that are addictive. The visit was unproductive, and the doctor seems primarily interested in writing prescriptions. A waste of time and money. I do not recommend.", "lang": "en"}
