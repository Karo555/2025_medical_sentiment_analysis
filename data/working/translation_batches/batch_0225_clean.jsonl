{"opinion_id": "op_004483", "text": "The doctor was very unpleasant. She didn't allow me to describe the medical history and kept interrupting. She didn't even look at the skin lesions because, as she put it, they were healed. Unfortunately, they are not healed because there are recurrences from time to time (she was told this). The primary care physician instructed to take photos of the lesions to show the dermatologist, but the doctor didn't want to look at them. She insisted that patches had been stuck on the skin lesions. When asked what we should do with one of the lesions, she said to go to a plastic surgeon but didn't know who issues referrals. She said she worked for a corporation so she doesn't know the procedures. Avoid this doctor at all costs.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_004484", "text": "The visit was a failure. It was private, so 180 z≈Ç was charged for about 10 minutes, but that's still better than NHS patients where the patient is leaving before they even properly enter. And worst of all, no specific diagnosis, ointments prescribed 'for everything possible' because maybe something will work. And at the internist, it turned out that two out of the three prescribed ointments absolutely cannot be combined. The internist knows this, but the dermatologist doesn't. Medication and money thrown away. I recommend staying far away.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_004487", "text": "After a long search for a good specialist, I came across the doctor, and seeing only good reviews, I decided to try. I've had acne problems for years and thought he would finally help me. Unfortunately, the doctor said '######' the moment I crossed the threshold of the office. No tests. No searching for the problem. Immediately, a medication that is heavy on the body was prescribed, which I had already taken for 9 months, but the doctor said it was safe. Plus birth control pills. After this explosive combination, I ended up in the ER. At the emergency room, they told me I have a categorical ban on taking these medications. Wasted my time, money, my hour-long trips to Krakow. I'm against him.", "lang": "en"}
