At the first visit, the doctor seemed very professional, so I scheduled my son for a second visit for a head ultrasound. The doctor performed the ultrasound, and since my son has had diarrhea for several days, I also asked for a medical consultation. My son is exclusively breastfed, and I suspected a food allergy that might be causing the diarrhea. The doctor prescribed 4 medications for the child; when I asked what they were for and why as many as 4, I was told that I could reduce the number of medications by half, or even by 70%. I asked him to explain to me what each medication was for and which ones were for diarrhea - in response, I was told that these were not medications but probiotics. When I asked why as many as 4, the doctor replied that he recommends that many and if I don't like it, I don't have to bring my child back and can consult another doctor. On the way out, he threw in that we were only scheduled for an ultrasound and he doesn't have time to explain anything to me. I should add that he collected money for the visit, in addition to the payment for the head ultrasound, of course.", "redacted": 0}

She is always patient, answers questions, and clarifies doubts - I have a package with LUX MED, but I don't change my gynecologist.

After 2 previous visits to 2 other doctors, I had a mess in my head, but I left the doctor's office satisfied and knew where I stood. The online consultations are also very good because I didn't have to drive 70 kilometers with the results; and that, of course, involves not only money but also time, which everyone is short of lately.

The Da Vinci robot already operates in many clinics worldwide; its systems have very strong patent protection. In the case of these operations, both the surgeon and the patient are usually in the same room,\" describes the PAP interviewee. In the TeleRobinHeart project, Dr. Paweł Kostka is developing control systems for surgical robots. Such systems can be divided into modules and placed in different locations around the world, and they will communicate via network links and operate as if they were next to each other. The most modern molecular biology techniques will be used in the research. Strączkowski estimates that the laboratory should start operating within the next two months. Blood and tissue analyses, e.g., adipose tissue, will be conducted. The research will be carried out within already ongoing research projects, but scientists will also apply for new grants for this purpose. The facility has already conducted, for example, one project on weight loss, body mass reduction in obese people based on dietary factors, and intends to conduct further ones. Strączkowski said that scientists wanted to be present in the Białystok Science and Technology Park because the laboratory where they will work there has been designed and prepared from the beginning with all the requirements related to the standards of scientific research in mind. \"These are very demanding studies in terms of room design.

This was indicated by, among others, cases of self-healing even of advanced cancer disease. However, only a few years ago, a huge breakthrough occurred in research on this phenomenon,\" explains Dr. Zagożdżon. As he recalls, until now, it was suspected that cancer \"escapes\" from the immune system, that it constantly changes so as not to be recognized by it. Therefore, research focused on methods that were supposed to make the immune system catch up with cancer. \"It's like we were constantly pressing the gas pedal in a car without knowing, however, that we were also dealing with a strongly engaged handbrake,\" says the specialist. As he says, in recent years, it has been understood that cancer uses other ways to defend itself against the immune system – it uses so-called checkpoints for this purpose. They serve the immune system to check whether encountered cells are the body's own cells or foreign cells, or pathologically changed cells. \"It's a bit like checking a passport,\" says Dr. Zagożdżon. Unfortunately, cancer \"learns\" to pretend that it is not foreign. \"Understanding this caused us to learn to disable the appropriate control mechanisms, and it turned out that thanks to this, the immune system can be much more effective in fighting cancer,\" he adds.", "redacted": 0}

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance require large, stationary equipment.

Moreover, the patient must be immobilized, and the examination itself is expensive. In practice, hospitals do not have any equipment allowing continuous monitoring of changes in the brain's microcirculation system directly at the patient's bedside. \"The possibility of continuous monitoring of cerebral circulation parameters may be crucial for the treatment process of patients with serious neurological damage.
