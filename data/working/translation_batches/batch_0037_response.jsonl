Lung transplantation can be a rescue for the most severely ill patients, but until recently, such a method was not used in this group of patients in Poland. The first to do so was the center in Zabrze, which runs the largest lung transplantation program in Poland. Lung transplantation is among the most difficult. Lungs are in constant contact with the external environment, so they are very exposed to infections. Despite the risk, the number of lung transplants is not decreasing because for seriously ill patients there are no other therapeutic options, as in the case of the heart - where, for example, pharmacological treatment can be extended.", "redacted": 0}

It has been used for centuries in natural medicine because it affects wound healing. The last very important thing is silver in nanoparticle form, i.e., nanosilver, which has strong bactericidal properties.

It is a gamma radiation emitter with an energy of 140 keV and a half-life of about 6 hours. 80 percent of medical procedures performed worldwide are carried out using technet-99m - reminds NCBJ director prof.

Now we have a reactor irradiating uranium targets and the POLATOM Radioisotope Center producing technet-99 generators. We lack a processing laboratory.\" Due to physical (half-life) and economic (transport costs) reasons, the processing laboratory should be built near the reactor. Polish scientists are preparing the project of this investment, but its estimated value is 35 million euros. NCBJ is trying to obtain appropriate funding. The investment would be located in Świerk, next to the MARIA reactor (irradiating uranium targets) and OR POLATOM (producing technet-99m generators). An additional advantage of such location is the proximity of the Radioactive Waste Disposal Plant, which would be the recipient of radioactive waste generated in the molybdenum-99 extraction process.

He didn't even send me for additional tests, saying there was no need because I had them done 5 years ago. Dr. Jan Kowalski first changed my prescribed medications and sent me for tests, which unfortunately showed some abnormalities. Moreover, he also made sure I supplemented vitamin deficiency and took care of my stomach, which, from taking a large amount of painkillers, is exposed to irritation. Each time he devoted 20 to 30 minutes of his time to me, I never encountered something like that at lux med! He discussed the test results with me, pointed out places where abnormalities are visible and explained what they consist of, without unnecessarily scaring me. We'll see what happens next, but for now I am satisfied and I see that something has moved. A big plus is also the availability of appointments with the doctor.", "redacted": 1}
