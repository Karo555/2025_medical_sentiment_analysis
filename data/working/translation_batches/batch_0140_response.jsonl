He decided to investigate what would happen to a plant kept constantly in darkness. It turned out that even without access to sunlight, the leaves opened and closed in a steady, daily rhythm, as if controlled by an internal clock. Over time, more 'clock-like' plants were discovered – Carl Linnaeus created the first 'flower clock' in Uppsala using flowers that open at specific hours (its accuracy was within a few minutes). Biological clocks, which help adjust physiology to the time of day, have also been observed in animals and humans. This regular adaptation is referred to as the circadian rhythm.", "redacted": 0}

I struggled with sciatica for three months, with terrible pain leading to a depressive state. After an MRI, I went privately to Dr. Jan Kowalski without a prior appointment – there was no problem. On Thursday, I had a consultation, and on Monday, I received a call to report to the hospital for surgery to remove a disc and eliminate the hernia. Everything happened very quickly and efficiently. A wonderful person and incredibly humble. Thank you once again, Doctor :)", "redacted": 1}

I've dealt with many doctors, and so far, Dr. Anna has gained my trust. I agree that she gives out her phone number and asks for an SMS with updates on the child's condition, which I think is a super approach to a young patient.

When I asked for a work certificate to lighten my duties, he called it a whim. When I went back about two weeks later with very heavy bleeding, he prescribed three packages of Duphaston (I don't know why, since the pregnancy was long over) and told me to rest. I won't say what I went through at that moment – only a woman who has lost a child can understand. I'm surprised this doctor works at Luxmed. Definitely do not recommend.

Pani Gawur was negatively disposed from the start for reasons unknown to me. She was snippy and addressed me condescendingly with 'listen, child...' I should add that I'm 27. Pani Gawur (I can't call her doctor, as I think it's an insult to the profession) didn't want to review my medical history or the results I brought. She only looked at the X-ray and said everything was fine, even though I tried to tell her that previous results showed otherwise, not to mention that I came with radiating back pain into my leg that hasn't subsided for two months. I expected a constructive conversation, but with this person, it was impossible to get a word in. She interrupted me mid-sentence, and when I hadn't finished, she said that was all and I should leave. I had an interview with a neurosurgeon who performs spine surgeries and wanted to share it and maybe learn something, but Pani Gawur had no idea such procedures even exist. They've been performed worldwide for 5 years, so maybe Pani Gawur should get trained in modern medicine. It's truly a shame and a misunderstanding that such an uneducated and off-putting person works in private healthcare. She asked disdainfully if I 'even have a subscription here,' because if not, she'd talk to me even worse, so I'd rather not imagine how. I was also struck by Pani Gawur's statement that 'well, this is Poland, nothing can be done.' I'd expect such a remark from an NHS employee, but when paying for private healthcare, such comments are out of place. In summary, I couldn't even get a word in to say why I came and explain what's happening. I was treated like trash and felt that way. I'm appalled by this woman's attitude and the fact that ENEL-Med employs her. I've never met such a horrible, unpleasant, contemptuous person, let alone a doctor. Where is her approach to people? Where is decent treatment? Where is passion for the profession or helping people? Where is empathy? The lack of all this is staggering. I wouldn't wish contact with this woman on anyone. After such a visit, you lose faith in people and basic human kindness.", "redacted": 1}

I believe this clinic deserves the highest rating, really. And I'm not writing this because I was charmed by Pan Janusz working at reception. However, I think having such a competent person in that position is an additional asset of this place. I called the clinic a few times between check-ups, and each time Pan Janusz gave me exhaustive answers. And he'll make tea in the waiting room and chat. :D Next, it's worth mentioning the hygiene at this place. Clean, fragrant, and sterile. Probably nothing more is needed. You can see that someone put a lot of heart into this clinic. Wonderful staff, thanks to whom the most important moment of my life became even better. And it might seem strange that I describe this place in nothing but superlatives, but what can I do if I see no minuses.

I ended up on his ward for rehabilitation (I was already after spine surgery, but Dr. Jan Kowalski wasn't my attending physician). As an 'outsider,' I felt very bad – after every ward round, I cried from frustration, and later the physiotherapists had to calm me down during exercises. He made various digs at me just because I wasn't his patient and said I shouldn't be on his rehabilitation ward but should go to Warsaw to the Medical Academy's Clinic of Orthopedics and Traumatology on Lindleya Street and get rehabilitated there. Explaining that there's no rehabilitation ward there and the clinic has no physiotherapists was useless. Additionally, the doctor made jokes about the doctor who operated on me, which I find uncultured. In medicine, not only medical knowledge matters, but patient approach is also important. And this doctor was unpleasant to me just because I was treated by another orthopedist, and it didn't matter that I was referred to the rehabilitation ward by his colleague from the orthopedics ward.", "redacted": 1}
