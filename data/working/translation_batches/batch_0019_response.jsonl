During technological processes, protein structures undergo changes, which may cause the exposure of allergenic fragments on the outside. As a result of contact with such a protein - an allergen, IgE class antibodies are produced in the body. For most people, antigens are safe. If a predisposed organism, in response to contact with an antigen, begins to rapidly produce IgE antibodies, then the antigen, as a foreign compound, is called + allergen + - emphasized Prof. Anna Kowalska. As scientists indicate, the causes of allergies are of two kinds. 50% of its occurrence is related to genetic predisposition, the other 50% can be attributed to the influence of the human living environment.", "redacted": 1}

You can start with 5-kilometer runs and then increase the distance to 10 kilometers, a half-marathon, and so on up to a marathon. During each participation in shorter distance races, besides checking your running abilities, it's worth focusing on observing your own body's behaviors and its reactions to crisis situations. Besides physical preparation, an appropriate diet both before and during the marathon is also important. You should plan how often, what types and amounts of fluids you will take, and how to replenish missing energy.", "redacted": 0}

With the full descriptive result of this examination along with the disc and 12 X-ray films, I reached Prof. Jan Kowalski, where a few days later we were given an appointment for a private consultation, which my wife and I were as happy about as \"children.\" During this consultation, Prof. Jan Kowalski, in the presence of three people, announced: \"I don't see anything here, there's nothing dangerous.\" To our question of the following content \"are there no cancerous changes in my wife?\" The answer from Prof. in our presence (three people) was as follows: \"But there are no cancerous changes; what the radiologist sees is not confirmed by a professor of neurosurgery; there is no such thing.\" Prof. prescribed my wife 3 medications in tablets and instructed her to take them sequentially. We thanked Prof. and left the private office very delighted. For two weeks, my wife took the prescribed medications, feeling worse each day, and the pressure pains were increasing, unbearable. To verify Prof. Nowak's diagnosis, I personally went to another neurosurgery clinic outside Poznań, where I delivered only the disc, without the description. The verdict was clear: my wife has a tumor in the IV ventricle that must be removed immediately. That's what happened, the operation was performed by the best neurosurgeon in the country - a doctor, a Professor with a Great Heart, and today my wife is recovering, feeling better and better... This luck of Prof. Nowak would have been a misfortune for us, as this tumor began to deepen more and more, increasing future complications during the operation and postoperative effects. I learned the opinions of doctors regarding further delay in operating on my wife. I do not comment on this internet entry; I provided dry facts that we encountered.", "redacted": 2}

Assisted by his substantive advice, I entered the \"difficult\" age of adolescence. I'm not writing this at all to feel a bit sorry for myself. I just wanted to emphasize that despite the resistant character of a teenager, the doctor managed. From what I noticed, for each patient, he develops a separate way of communicating, corresponding to the needs, character of the patient. Besides purely medical advice, I received other - more life-related. This shows that Mr. Kowalski is a sensitive and aware person. He is very direct, which can only be considered a plus, it's easier to establish a connection with him. If, without knowing medicine, I can assess, I consider His help professional. The visits weren't too long, nor too short, I left without a muddle in my head, which can often appear after talking with a specialist.

I got into the hospital within 3 weeks. After another week, I left it. Other patients in the ward waited a long time for their doctor's visit, procedure, etc. The doctor is indeed grumpy, but only when you ask him too many questions. Simply, he is a choleric, it happens. You shouldn't take his outbursts personally. Good advice - ask the head nurse about whatever you can, and only ask the doctor about what he doesn't want to answer. He is a great specialist, undertakes operations that others are afraid of. Always honestly says what he can and what he cannot do. Informs the patient about the effects of the operation and the associated risk. But he won't say directly - you must have the operation. He always leaves the decision to the patient, says e.g., like this: if you have the operation, you will be cured, symptoms will subside. If you don't have the operation, you may become paralyzed, but it won't happen too quickly, it might not happen at all, but there is a risk. The decision is yours. Some don't like this style and start pressing the doctor whether they should or shouldn't have the operation, then the doctor gets annoyed because he explained the threats and effects of the operation and is waiting for the decision.", "redacted": 0}
