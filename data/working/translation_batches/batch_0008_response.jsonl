{"opinion_id": "op_000141", "lang": "en", "text": "04/27/2015. Dr. Jan Tabakow performed surgery on my spine. He \"installed\" a stabilizing implant between the vertebrae in the lumbar region. The time before the surgery, when back pain accompanied me throughout the day, to a greater or lesser extent, and in the evening when it was time to sleep, the pain would peak—I don't even remember it anymore! Now I feel wonderful, the pain has subsided. There is a definite improvement. And what is also important, Dr. Jan Tabakow made an effort, and the scar from the incision is minimal. I was prepared for a much larger cut/scar ;) When the time for surgery came, I didn't even have any doubts; I knew I was in good hands and that everything would go according to plan. I had full trust in Dr. Jan Tabakow. The doctor himself builds trust through his professionalism. You talk to him and know that he is the right person in the right place. He explained everything thoroughly and answered my questions. He was with me before the surgery and after. I will never forget how after the surgery, when I was waking up, Dr. Jan Tabakow was by my side—it might seem like nothing, but it is incredibly important to feel that a trusted person is with you and making sure everything is alright—I sincerely thank Dr. Jan Tabakow for these small—BIG gestures. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Jan Tabakow; he is a skilled and reliable person. And very friendly at that. Thank you very much, Doctor! :) Best regards, Anna Kowalska. P.S. My family joins in the thanks, as they no longer have to listen to my complaints. (\"it hurts\").", "redacted": 2}

Of course, she included homeopathy, which only worsened my daughter's condition because she told us to stop other medications, and the child had a fever for a week, and she didn't prescribe antibiotics (I know that overuse is harmful, but she went too far in the other direction). When I called a doctor for a home visit, he was shocked at how a child could be treated like that; we almost ended up in the hospital. Besides, she is not polite; my daughter kept crying around her and wouldn't let herself be examined, which hasn't happened since we changed doctors. Pani dr. often appears on TV, probably because she has few patients, as she sits in Damian all day, and when I look online, she has the most available spots.", "redacted": 0}

First, scientists wanted to find out why there is no high risk of methane explosion in Bogdanka, as is the case in mines in Silesia. It turned out that in the coal-bearing rocks in Bogdanka, there are bacteria—methanotrophs—that \"feed on\" methane. \"These are the invisible allies of the miners in our mine,\" she emphasized. Then, they analyzed how these bacteria live and function in such harsh conditions, over a kilometer underground, with low humidity and elevated salt concentrations in the environment. \"We discovered that ectoine protects them.

I highly recommend. Rehabilitation ended after 7 visits. Currently, Emilka is 7 months old and is already crawling and trying to stand up.

I was sick, that's a fact, but with this treatment, it was even worse. I was treated for a long time after the medications prescribed by Dr. Jan Ziemniak. Unfortunately, he didn't consider that I might be allergic to gluten.

Someone suggested that there are shorter queues for ophthalmologists in Wola, so we called and got an appointment in less than three weeks. The impressions of all three of us were identical—an incredibly nice, approachable Pani Doktor. We were examined, and during the exams, she explained what she was doing. Then, each of us had our problem explained, and we were prescribed medications and glasses. It's terrible, but it turned out that Pani Tymowska was the first to realize that I have astigmatism and fitted me with glasses with cylinders, through which I finally see well. At home, I have about 5 (sic!) pairs of glasses that unfortunately didn't allow me to see freely and clearly because they were poorly fitted. Plus, eye drops—\"the cheaper ones, because they work the same as the expensive ones, so why should you pay for unnecessary bells and whistles.\" And on top of that, at the end, she walked me to the door. I felt like an incredibly important patient. I was a little afraid that I would wake up from this beautiful dream. But my husband and mother had the same experiences and weren't sleeping : - ) ) ) ) Thank you, Pani Doktor.", "redacted": 1}

Which one is next—she always asks the nurses or parents. During the visit, she rushes, doesn't give time to think or ask questions, and if any are asked, she dismisses them in a few words.

The whole time, suggestions that the child was poorly treated, etc., even though the little one was 4.5 years old, and the problems started when he went to kindergarten (a hard-to-cure cough after infections); until then, he hadn't been sick. She prescribed a ton of medications that I didn't buy, and when I asked if Diphenhydramine three times a day was necessary, the answer suggested that the question was stupid and that I was trying to question the doctor's competence (that's how I felt). The staphylococcus that the little one had earlier in his throat was treated by doctors with Bactrim, which Pani doktor found incomprehensible, and on the prescription, I also got Bactrim... After this visit, I felt like an irresponsible idiot, and my child stopped coughing with the arrival of spring, without this wonderful treatment. I definitely do not recommend.

It also uses too much omega-6 acid. Isolating pure ALA is the way to eliminate low-intensity systemic inflammation, which causes most civilization diseases. This condition is responsible for the development of atherosclerosis and, consequently, for brain strokes, heart attacks, diseases of the lower limbs and circulatory system, and clogging of arteries. Low-intensity systemic inflammation also includes cancers and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease,\" lists Tomasz Wysoczański. He emphasizes that there are many causes of these diseases, including stress, body pollution. But an important cause is the deficiency of omega-3 acids and excess of omega-6 acids. The latter come from, among others, rapeseed and sunflower oil. When the body uses dense, saturated acids to build the cell membrane, our cells communicate worse with the external environment. The cell membrane is too thick, and the cell cannot function properly. This is how disease processes, including cancerous ones, begin.", "redacted": 1}
