Dr. Jan Kowalski cared for me from the moment I started having problems getting pregnant. The only doctor who actually sought solutions. Later, I felt I was in good hands when I miscarried. Dr. Jan Kowalski showed great empathy. Then another pregnancy managed flawlessly. Many tests, thorough ultrasounds, excellent care. In the hospital, he also asked how I was feeling and if everything was alright. I highly recommend this doctor.", "redacted": 1}

The Foundation for the Development of Cardiac Surgery has, since its inception, also run an extensive, self-funded training and scholarship program in cardiac surgery aimed at enhancing the professional qualifications of medical staff from Poland and abroad, especially from Eastern European countries. So far, over 180 people have benefited from the program, including several dozen teams of doctors from Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine, as well as scholarship holders from the Czech Republic, Croatia, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Argentina, and the United States.

After our first meeting, I knew I was in good hands : ) From the very beginning, Anna asked a lot of questions, cleared up my doubts, and solved all problems. The plan developed by Anna exceeded my wildest expectations. The dishes introduced by Anna were not only healthy but above all delicious. Moreover, Anna continuously suggested new culinary ideas and new products that I hadn't known before, which turned out to be a bullseye for my taste. Furthermore, Anna is a life optimist, able to help in any situation and provide moral support. I could write a lot more about how Anna engages wholeheartedly in her work, but I think that's not the point here. If someone needs advice on nutrition, I assure you that Anna will meet your expectations.", "redacted": 1}

In subsequent years, Robash's team discovered, among other things, several other genes involved in regulating circadian rhythms in fruit flies. For his contribution to understanding the biological clock, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on October 2, 2017. He shared it with Jeff C.

Unlike many doctors in private facilities, Dr. Majkowski is not commercially oriented (for the second visit as a follow-up, I paid only 50 PLN, and when I was at risk of dehydration, instead of charging for the visit, the doctor sent me to the emergency department over the phone so I wouldn't wait for the scheduled appointment).

He added that in ALS, the progression of the disease \"is linear, meaning the patient's condition deteriorates at a constant rate.\" \"Determining that some factor, in this case, the administration of stem cells, modifies the course of this disease by slowing it down shows the effectiveness of this element's influence,\" explained Siwek.

During the visit, I learned that the tooth was vertically cracked and not suitable for treatment and that the tooth needed to be removed. The lady doctor advised me to get an implant (cost 4000 PLN) or proposed that she could make a bridge for about 1400 PLN (I'll note that the adjacent teeth are healthy and never treated, so a bridge would mean grinding and destroying them). I didn't let the tooth be removed and left the office paying 100 PLN for taking an X-ray, temporarily sealing the tooth, and the information that nothing could be done with it. For the next 2 weeks, I came to terms with the thought that I would lose my first tooth, said goodbye to it in the mirror, and studied materials related to implants. Before scheduling the tooth extraction, I decided to consult the opinion given by the lady doctor with another dentist. The male doctor, whom I can heartily recommend to everyone, diagnosed a vertical crack in the side wall of the tooth extending a few millimeters under the gum and said that the tooth was very much treatable. The cracked part of the tooth was removed, and the gum was lifted. At the next visit, the tooth was root canal treated and rebuilt with a post. The whole thing cost me 600 PLN, and I saved my tooth. In my case, the visit to the lady doctor was a misdiagnosis, two weeks of stress, and wasted money. I do not recommend this dentist.", "redacted": 0}
