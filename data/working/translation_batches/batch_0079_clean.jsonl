Several times I wondered whether to give up His advice, precisely because of this lack of warmth and kindness that we women expect from a gynecologist.

He has been treating me for half a year, I undertake a 2.5-hour journey to Krakow - but it's worth it.", "lang": "en"}

Dr. Jan Kowalski recognized them immediately and ordered tests. He managed my pregnancy until delivery. Before delivery, he predicted complications that could arise due to hormonal disorders caused by improper thyroid function. His predictions came true. Thanks to the fact that he referred me to the hospital earlier and that I was under careful care, doctors could make a quick decision about a cesarean section, which saved our child's life. I highly recommend the doctor.", "lang": "en"}

At the same time, she detected hypothyroidism, and now Hashimoto has developed. For all these 9 years she has always given me referrals for tests, analyses, yes she likes to prescribe her favorite medications, but you have to press her and then she says what for, why, etc. Generally, if you talk with her, she will refer for other tests too, you just need to outline your problem well and be inquisitive, and not take something ad hoc because it's prescribed. Now I'm also getting steroids and hormones, I'm waiting for effects, but I told her when there was no effect and it was ok, no hard feelings after all she is not God and how is she supposed to know everything right away, she also has to experiment a bit before hitting the mark. Recently I lost a lot of hair, feeling that it was from the hormones... At first the doctor wasn't convinced that it could be so, but at the second visit it was possible, she took interest and ordered tests and I saw that she was considering that it might be so, although she says that no one has complained about such symptoms from thyroid hormones before... Maybe some of you also have this? The doctor is worth recommending! Just question her, and don't count on her saying something herself :)", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_001567", "text": "Palladium is a very expensive element, which is why in palladium catalysts it is important to evenly distribute nanoparticles of this metal on the carrier surface. This condition is met by the catalyst synthesized at Jagiellonian University based on ZSM5 zeolite - a porous silicon-aluminum material with an ordered structure. After leaching out some silicon atoms and coating the material with palladium, scientists obtained a catalyst. Measurements at IChF PAN proved that it is extremely effective in removing trichloroethylene from water. From a practical point of view, the fact that in the new catalyst palladium immediately occurs in reduced form is also important, meaning it is ready for use immediately after synthesis. \"For many years it was believed that zeolites were not suitable for hydrodechlorination reactions because they are not resistant to the reaction mixture. However, in our experiments we showed that a very efficient palladium catalyst can be created based on them. It is precisely the high efficiency and speed of action that make the new catalyst so interesting despite the use of palladium\" - says Dr. Anna Kowalska.", "lang": "en"}

These pilot works involve introducing nanoparticles into living organisms and studying the mechanisms of their absorption and how they spread through the organism with the bloodstream.

{"opinion_id": "op_001572", "text": "I was at Dr. Anna Kowalska and I am very disappointed. I came to her with bad results - TSH (norm is 0.5 - 2.5) I had significantly elevated up to 3.9, the reason for the visit was hair falling out in handfuls. The doctor did not find anything alarming and certainly no suspicion of thyroid, because that is (in her opinion unlikely). She couldn't directly state the cause of weakened hair condition. I on the other hand forcefully asked for suggestions of other tests that could determine it. She said she assumes \"from the start\" that everything is ok and that I'm probably panicking, but since I care so much I should do FT4 and ANTI TPO... Summarizing, leaving the office I didn't know more than when I entered, adding that I had 150 z≈Ç less in my wallet. I did those tests, went to another doctor and based on the TSH results another endocrinologist stated that the cause lies in the thyroid, I got the appropriate hormone and the hair condition has significantly improved - after 3 weeks I can say that less is falling out. I definitely do not recommend a visit to Dr. Anna Kowalska, why? 1. the meeting is very short 7-10 min 2. no interview with the patient is conducted 3. the doctor does not examine the patient and gives very laconic answers At a visit with another endocrinologist, which I am very satisfied with, I was listened to, there was blood pressure check, height, weight, breast examination, thyroid check - manual examination, interview with the patient, answers were very exhaustive and most importantly I received the help I cared so much about.", "lang": "en"}
