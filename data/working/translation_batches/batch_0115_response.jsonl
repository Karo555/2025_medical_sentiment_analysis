That one examined me from every angle for half a year. Finally it turned out that I had elevated prolactin, and when I got the medication, after 2 weeks I was pregnant. Of course I never had polycystic ovaries. Did he also show you by twisting his arms how you have twisted fallopian tubes due to retroversion? And that's why you can't get pregnant?

I spent some time looking for an orthodontist specialist for my daughter and decided that I would have her treated by Dr. Anna Kowalska. I scheduled my daughter for an appointment. At the first appointment, my daughter had - as I was informed - all tests done. Only the next appointment was supposed to be with Dr. Anna Kowalska and based on the tests the treatment plan was to be discussed. My husband went to this appointment with the child. How surprised I was when he informed me upon return that my daughter had some more tests done, and only at the next appointment would the treatment scheme be discussed. She was also seen by a completely different doctor. I called the office to clarify the situation. The lady at the reception couldn't explain why all tests weren't done at the first appointment, as had been agreed earlier. Only now did she also bother to inform me that the doctor had been changed because Dr. Anna Kowalska doesn't have time and won't be treating my daughter. I didn't need to look for an office 100 km from my town to have my child treated by anyone, so I gave up treatment at this office. But then it turned out that Dr. Anna Kowalska would find time and a new appointment was scheduled. I let go of the topic of the completely unnecessary visit that was conducted due to sloppiness on the part of the office and failure to ensure that all tests were done at the first appointment. We waited a month for the next appointment. The day before the scheduled appointment, I received a call from the office that Dr. Anna Kowalska actually doesn't have time and they're transferring my child to the doctor who saw her last time. In this situation, I definitely gave up treatment at this office, demanding the return of test results and the costs of the unjustified visit. I received the results after multiple phone reminders the day before an appointment at another office. The cost of the visit was refused.", "redacted": 6}

{"opinion_id": "op_002298", "lang": "en", "text": "Proper bone structure is the result of the activity of two cell types. The first are osteoblasts, they create the mineral scaffolding of bones. The second type are osteoclasts. These cells are responsible for bone resorption, meaning they absorb bones, they are phagocytic cells. The balance between the opposing activities of these two cell types is regulated by hormones, neurotransmitters and cytokines. Urszula Kędzierska intends to learn the signaling pathways activated in bone cells by cytokines. As she explains, when infection occurs, the activated immune system produces pro-inflammatory cytokines. These proteins are signaling molecules and carry information about threat understandable to most cells of the body. The organism switches to \"emergency mode\" and develops a systemic inflammatory response. Such a state is not a state of balance, functions of other systems are disturbed and subordinated to the main goal which is survival.", "redacted": 1}
