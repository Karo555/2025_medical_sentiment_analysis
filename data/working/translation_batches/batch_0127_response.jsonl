Accurate diagnoses and quick reactions, and above all, incredible effectiveness. As far as I know, he worked very hard to have no trouble with patients; it's always full, and he works 12 hours a day, even though he probably doesn't have to, but that's my opinion :) If any lady claims otherwise, I dare suspect she is simply annoying and hasn't met many doctors. We as a nation have this trait to complain and expect immediate miracles, which is also visible in the opinions. As for prices, the doctor has normal, national prices, even lower than sometimes outside Warsaw. I won't comment on the rest and sincerely recommend Dr. Jan Kowalski as a great specialist!", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_002522", "lang": "en", "text": "As emphasized by Dr. Anna Kowalska from the Institute of Food and Nutrition in Warsaw, during heatwaves, hydrating the body is also very important. We cannot forget about products rich in nutrients, especially micro- and macroelements. \"This is particularly important due to the fact that on hot days we eat much less, thus supplying the body with significantly fewer nutrients. Therefore, besides water, let's not forget other products, reach for fruit and vegetable juices, fruits and vegetables, whole grain products, which will replenish potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, but also fiber, phosphorus, manganese, and iron. These substances affect the proper functioning of the body; some of them help prevent dehydration,\" advises the specialist. It's worth reaching for vegetables and fruits significantly more often than five times a day. Watermelon will be particularly valuable during this period, as it is 92% water and has low energy value: about 30 kcal per 100 grams. Additionally, it contains potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and sodium. Melon or pear will have a similar effect on the body. In summer, it's good to switch to salads supplemented with whole grain pasta or a piece of meat or cheese. Tomato juice will also be a source of practically all valuable nutrients. We can find potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, but also vitamin C, vitamin B6, beta-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin K. It is extremely rich in fiber, so not only does it supply the body with fluids, but it also satisfies hunger excellently.", "redacted": 1}

Pani Nadia is not at all as nice and professional; I also had treatment with her, and unfortunately, a month later, a piece of the tooth treated by Pani Doktor broke off; I also have doubts about the color. As for the prices, it's not all rosy either; the first visit and estimate were free, but later during treatment, Pani Doktor does not stick to that estimate.

Admittedly, the rash practically disappeared, except on the neck, but the scalp itching still occurs; I would even say it's stronger, unbearable.

I have dealt with several Krakow gynecologists with excellent opinions and many years of work experience; I must state that Dr. Jan Kowalski lacks nothing compared to them.

At the outset, I was scolded for only coming to the phoniatrician now (unfortunately, I cannot afford private visits, so I waited almost a year for an NHS visit). The examination was done quite professionally, but the words I heard after the examination stunned me. Pani Doktor is very arrogant. She told me to stop singing, and best not to speak at all. That if I want to sing, I first need to learn how to sing, not scream my mouth off. For someone who sings professionally with success, this is quite sad news. The examination showed that I have singing nodules and need immediate rehabilitation (of course, very expensive).
