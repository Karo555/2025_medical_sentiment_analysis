From the very entrance, she was very unpleasant, I have the impression that only halfway through the visit after opening the file on the computer and seeing that the patient has a \"VIP\" package, she changed her attitude and toned it down (!) as if it mattered what kind of patient she was dealing with. I do not recommend visits unless necessary. There are plenty of wonderful pediatricians at LUX MED.", "lang": "en"}

As it turned out, these tests were very necessary because metastases occurred and a quick reaction and further treatment were needed. Shifting responsibility from herself, the Doctor suggested calling an ambulance. The several-hour wait outside the office for a treatment completion certificate was also not pleasant.

{"opinion_id": "op_001947", "text": "Treating small tumors not only has a better prognosis but does not always require immediate treatment. It is enough then to just observe whether the tumor is enlarging. \"Some of them develop slowly, in such situations one can wait until disease progression occurs,\" the specialist assured. Such a strategy is used in the case of prostate cancer in men. It can also be applied to patients with kidney cancer when the tumor does not exceed 3 cm and is not enlarging. Treatment mainly involves surgical removal of the tumor or the entire kidney. When the cancer is not large, it is enough to remove part of the kidney. Then there is a choice of minimally invasive surgery involving tumor removal by so-called cryoablation (by freezing), radiofrequency waves, laser, or ultrasound.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_001948", "text": "Hello, I have been in treatment since the end of October. I reacted very quickly to the worrying behaviors of my person by seeking help. I needed not only pharmacological support but understanding from another person, conversation and explanation, which ultimately allowed me to accept myself, not be afraid, and calm my inner anxiety. A joint meeting with my spouse also proved valuable; Pani Anna herself suggested this, which helped a lot. Importantly, she does not want to help only through medication but also to solve the problem at its source. As a result, that is already in the past. I look positively to the future. Pani Anna is not only a doctor but a confidant of our worries and problems, she knows how to listen and empathize with the patient's problem, gives a sense of security, I think this is her professional success because this work is her fulfillment, and we as patients benefit from it. I greatly respect what Pani does, warm regards : )", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_001951", "text": "There are several reasons for this. First, data on drug metabolism, e.g., cocaine, come from the 1950s. For ethical reasons, no one today studies the pharmacokinetics of intoxicating substances on volunteers, hence the lack of new data. Moreover, the metabolism of these compounds is always somewhat different in healthy people and in addicted people, and this is not taken into account in these studies. A very large error is caused by the sewer system - how old it is and to what extent it leaks. From research conducted in Germany and Switzerland, it appears that during leaks and overflows after rains, about 50% of sewage may not reach the treatment plant. Furthermore, the flow value given by the treatment plant is burdened with an error of about 20%, and additionally, some substances degrade along the way.", "lang": "en"}

Previously, I was treated at one of Warsaw's medical centers, where gynecologists were terrible, they only knew how to treat with medications that didn't help, and when they did a colposcopy and it wasn't normal, the best thing was to cut everything out, without trying other methods and without asking if the patient had given birth or not. I am very satisfied with Pan Doktor because he knows his stuff. It is known that you have to pay for all tests, but I go to him with pleasure and pay, even though I have a pass purchased by the company at one of Warsaw's medical centers.

I had been planning to go to an allergist for two years... the reason was a runny nose, constant cough, and a rash. I was taking antihistamine medications, which unfortunately stopped working as I expected. First impression at the visit? - Finally, I found a doctor who asks questions and listens to the answers!! I did quite a few tests, which doesn't surprise me, since allergology is rather a field where we rely on results but also on what the patient says. The tests showed that I am allergic to apples and bananas, which terribly surprised me. I didn't think that a food allergy doesn't give the reaction everyone talks about - stomach ache, vomiting. I decided to stop eating apples and to my surprise after a few days the runny nose stopped! the rash remained, which I am observing on the Professor's advice. I am writing down what I ate each day and what cosmetics I used... we'll see if I manage to discover this way what causes the rash = ) Overall, I warmly recommend a visit to the Professor.

I had never been pregnant before, which I informed Pani doktor about. Pani doktor did an ultrasound on me and stated that the pregnancy was not visible and she could not confirm it, then told me to come back in two weeks. I informed her that I wouldn't withstand such a long time in uncertainty and asked her if there were other ways to confirm it faster, then Pani doktor asked me: \"and why do you want to know that? do you want to tell someone about it?\" I was surprised, because after all, this is rather important information. I answered that I want to know if I already have to take double care of myself (that should be obvious). Pani doktor stated that tests are often wrong (I did two tests from different companies, so it's strange that both would be wrong). I got a referral for a blood beta hcg test. Pani doktor informed me that if it is elevated it indicates pregnancy, but that I shouldn't be happy yet, because it could be an ectopic pregnancy. It's not known where this pregnancy is and what it is like. Scared and shocked, I left the office. Pani doktor stressed and scared me a lot. Worried about an ectopic pregnancy, I couldn't sleep at night, I cried. The next day I went to another doctor and only there did I hear that I shouldn't worry, because in such an early pregnancy (about 4 weeks), it is normal that nothing is visible on ultrasound and that there is nothing that could so early indicate an ectopic pregnancy! and that there is no basis for such thinking! I think that Pani doktor unjustly and groundlessly scared me, instead of informing me in which week the pregnancy should already be visible and possibly then, if it wasn't visible, one could even mention an ectopic pregnancy. Additionally, I did not receive any recommendations regarding nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation. Lack of a gynecological examination as part of the visit, lack of asking about a current Pap smear. Pani doktor apparently assumed that I was not pregnant, which did not turn out to be true. After the visit, I felt terrible and felt much more uncertainty and fear than before the visit. I do not recommend.", "lang": "en"}
