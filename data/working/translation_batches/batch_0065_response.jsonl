Irrevocably and definitively, and according to him I don't even qualify for IVF. He ruled that it was too late for me to get pregnant. I changed doctors and learned that infertility is diagnosed after a year of trying and observation... not from one blood test. He considered Dr. Jan Kowalski's diagnosis unjustified, and a month later I started ovulating - without stimulation or medication - simply - month after month I ovulated. A year has passed since the visit to Dr. Jan Kowalski - we're not pregnant yet,,, my husband has somewhat weak sperm, but next month we'll have insemination. That visit still hurts - it was so unpleasant and surprising... words fail to describe the devastation that diagnosis and Dr. Jan Kowalski's behavior caused in us. I'm warning you - because he not only gives wrong diagnoses, but pulls them out of thin air, not from facts...", "redacted": 2}

It was found that shortly after use it impairs motor and cognitive functions - for example, it slows reflexes - hence in many countries driving after smoking marijuana is rightly prohibited. This substance also impairs short-term memory - that's why smoking a joint before a college exam can have disastrous consequences for students. However, data cited by the Krakow neuropharmacologist (from the 90s of the last century) indicate that less than 10% of marijuana smokers become permanently addicted to it. In light of this data, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol and amphetamine have much stronger addictive effects.", "redacted": 0}

What do you do with them? R.M.: These sets are unprocessed, they need to be assembled. Nowadays sequencing involves cutting DNA into many small pieces and putting those pieces back together. Just like a puzzle. If we have sequences of a well-studied organism, the analysis can be compared to looking at the puzzle box cover. We look where those pieces fit and connect them. That's quite simple. But when sequencing new species we don't have that cover and don't know how to assemble them. And these are quite complicated analyses.", "redacted": 0}

Of course, another doctor didn't confirm this \"diagnosis\". And she got pregnant normally and without problems.

A cold person in the pediatrics profession seems like a mistake. We went because of our son's constipation, the first question from the doctor was about constipation in the family, no questions about the amount of food, amount of water consumed, etc... The doctor approached my son directly from the keyboard without even putting on gloves. According to the recommendations of our previous pediatrician whom we unfortunately had to change, we use Sudocrem for diaper care because even Linomag caused our son to develop diaper rash. The doctor said that Sudocrem is a bad idea and that we're neglecting his penis, even though it was only slightly soiled with Sudocrem, then she stretched his penis so that it cracked in three places. Complete lack of gentleness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The child started screaming, not to mention what we had at home. We'll never go to this doctor again and won't recommend her to anyone, on the contrary we'll advise against her. Total lack of professionalism. Additionally, the doctor said we should give gluten in every meal to our 7-month-old baby, I came home and what - it's recommended to give gluten in larger amounts than 1-2 teaspoons per day only from the 10th month. The doctor didn't hear my words repeated several times that the little one was premature. Overall the visit was very short, quick and unpleasant, kind of impersonal. We have comparison with how a real pediatrician behaves, but unfortunately we had to change due to switching insurance packages and we really regret it.

However, in the case of this medication, it was written beyond standard with an explanation of why to definitely avoid it.

{"opinion_id": "op_001295", "lang": "en", "text": "Science festivals are a good place to promote proper behaviors related to health and hearing care. Various types of hearing disorders affect every 6th child in elementary school. Some of them are hearing losses caused by noise. Hearing is physics. For our perception of sounds, two parameters are crucial - pitch and volume. The higher the volume, the greater the energy of waves reaching our ear. If noise exceeds 130 dB, we no longer distinguish sounds, we only feel pain. Pitch is a consequence of how fast, meaning how many times per second, the object being the sound source vibrates. The number of vibrations per second is called frequency and is measured in hertz. Human hearing starts registering sounds at 16 Hz frequency, below this limit we have infrasounds, which are heard by e.g. elephants. We stop hearing sounds when they exceed 20 kHz, beyond that are ultrasounds audible to dogs and used for echolocation by bats and dolphins.", "redacted": 0}
