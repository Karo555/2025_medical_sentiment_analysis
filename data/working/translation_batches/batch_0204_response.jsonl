After a short conversation with Mr. Jan, I knew I had nothing to fear. I felt cared for and understood. Nothing was done that would cause me pain, at most discomfort resulting from working on a tense muscle. The facility itself is pleasant, the lady at the reception was very nice and helpful. I recommend", "redacted": 1}

Very thorough ultrasound examination, focused not only on investigating the problem but also on ensuring the absence of other dysfunctions in the knee joints.
