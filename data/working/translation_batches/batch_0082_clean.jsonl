My request for a referral for a mammogram was dismissed with a refusal, because she refused diagnostic tests that were supposed to take place in the hospital (3 days). Can't the ultrasound and markers, which are among these diagnostic tests, be done on an outpatient basis instead of admitting the patient to the ward for 3 days, because economic reasons take precedence? Not long ago, there was a program on television about oncology patients who, instead of staying in the hospital after radiotherapy, had a room rented for them in a hotel by the hospital, because it's both more economical and better for the patient's psyche. But not at the Oncology Clinic on Weigla Street, they go against the tide.", "lang": "en"}

The version of the draft regulation presented by the ME for public consultation met with opposition from local governments and environmental organizations. Critics pointed out, among other things, that the proposed standards do not eliminate the sale of slurries and flotoconcentrates at all, because they allow for the legal sale of their mixtures with better quality coal. Minister Jan Kowalski, in turn, stated that \"the provisions of the regulation (...) meet social expectations and take into account the possibilities of purchasing fuels by the least wealthy households\". Minister Anna Kowalska emphasized that she is in constant contact with the ME and is convinced that within a few weeks it will be possible to finalize work on the regulation so that it leaves no doubts. As the minister announced, the next stage will be the ZONE project (integrated system for supporting the policy and programs for reducing low emissions), which the Ministry will implement together with the NCBR and other institutions, including the Polish Smog Alarm. This is not only better monitoring, but also an assessment of the number of houses requiring modernization, in order to estimate the costs of improving air quality - she indicated. We also want to conduct the first such lung tests on a population of 25,000 people living in 9 towns with significant exceedances of air quality standards - added Kowalska.", "lang": "en"}

Currently without major problems, although I sometimes feel moderate pain, especially if I sit a lot, and I have a sedentary job. I went to a physiotherapist because I primarily wanted to return to systematic strengthening and preventive exercises. Jan Kowalski was recommended to me by another valued physiotherapist as a specialist in stabilization exercises. Jan first took a very detailed history and familiarized himself with the medical documentation. He took time to prepare an action plan, which he then discussed in detail. Additionally, he explained to me the essence of my ailment and the way to work on it. He introduces exercises gradually, according to my abilities and progress made. Thanks to this, I have a sense of security and full control over what we are doing. Of course, the effectiveness of the therapy depends largely on me, i.e., the more I exercise, the better it is. Jan tries to motivate for systematic exercises. He likes to talk and always patiently explains issues of anatomy, the functioning of our body, and the specifics of the ailment. Furthermore, there is always good telephone contact with him. To summarize, I definitely recommend Jan as a professional and effective physiotherapist.", "lang": "en"}

I (the mother) have gluten intolerance, so very loose and frequent stools prompted us to look for a solution to this problem in that direction. The child additionally (one and a half years old) gained only 400 grams in half a year. The doctor stated that the child is not gaining weight because I give him too little wheat! But as we know, you gain weight from wheat... I was very surprised by this statement, especially coming from a gastroenterologist. Low weight gain indicates malabsorption, which also suggests celiac disease. As part of the consultation, we received a recommendation not to see the doctor again, and any tests for celiac disease she advised to do on our own, because she sees no indications. I will add that the visit was under the NHS, and the tests in question are reimbursed, although very expensive. In my opinion, the doctor was neither nice nor competent. I think that if it had been a private visit, where tests are done at your own expense anyway, the conversation would have been completely different.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_001628", "text": "I think I can now give an opinion about Dr. Jan Kowalski. Certainly a very good specialist and I can't complain about that. I had the opportunity to be with him for 3 visits during pregnancy, because in LuxMed, fetal anatomy assessment tests are performed by him. The first visit was scheduled for 24.12 - very important prenatal tests that can be performed at a strictly defined stage of pregnancy. The day before, I got a call from LuxMed that the doctor had fallen ill and my appointment was canceled. Fortunately, it was still 23.12 when they called me, so the day before Christmas Eve I had to get my husband out of work to make it. I will add that it is not pleasant to be an \"additional patient\" because then you have to \"squeeze into\" the office, and with such an important examination, this situation should not occur. The visit was short, the doctor said that the baby was still too small (despite being within the range) and that we should come to his private office on 29.12. Earlier, of course, he had to make sure if I had that visit in my subscription. Visit 29.12 - 40 min waiting. I was supposedly booked for a specific time, but it turned out that the rule \"first come, first served\" applies. To collect the blood results and test descriptions, I had to ask for 2 weeks and call every other day. Finally, I succeeded. For the 3rd visit, I went to Dr. Kowalski for the mid-pregnancy scan on 17.02. A similar situation - a call from LuxMed the day before, that the doctor had fallen ill and the visit was canceled. The nearest appointment a week later, 24.02, again as an \"additional patient\", because there is no chance for an appointment at a specific time a week earlier. Once again an important visit and once again camping outside the office and \"squeezing into\" the office. This time an hour's wait. I could have waited indefinitely, because the doctor does not practice calling patients by name, but \"next\", and the girls in the queue were figuring out who was for what time, so I just had to lie. Unfortunately, I have to look for a new attending physician, because mine is leaving LuxMed and I thought about Dr. Kowalski, but I cannot afford constant cancellations of visits in a situation where I am on sick leave and need another one on a specific day. I don't care if he remembers my name, because he is undeniably the best specialist in his field and here I rate him even 6 stars, but all these situations that took place undermine my trust in him as a doctor. I get the impression that he is more interested in patients in his private practice, and LuxMed is just an addition.", "lang": "en"}

I lay down on the procedure table and the doctor performed the colonoscopy on me without anesthesia. I would rather give birth to a child than go through that again. I was writhing in pain on the table and the nurse was holding me down so I wouldn't run away.

They were developed by an international team of experts chaired by Dr. Jan Kowalski. \"We developed recommendations for all age groups â€“ from pregnant women, through newborns, infants, children, adolescents, adults to seniors. We also included people from groups particularly at risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as obese people and those working the night shift,\" explained the specialist. And so, for children up to 6 months of age, experts recommend administering 400 international units (IU), i.e., 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day; toddlers aged from six months to 12 months should receive from 400 to 600 IU, depending on the amount of vitamin D in the diet; children and adolescents up to 18 years of age should take 600-1000 IU depending on body weight â€“ all year round, if adequate skin exposure to the sun is not ensured during the summer months. Doses for adults have been set at 800-2000 IU, depending on body weight and all year round, if adequate skin synthesis is not ensured from April to September. In pregnant women, supplementation with vitamin D in doses of 1500-2000 IU should begin no later than the second trimester of pregnancy.", "lang": "en"}

I learned about Mr. Jan from a friend. He made his initial diagnosis only after a week of tests and trial treatment, I encountered something like this for the first time. I'll say this, it wasn't easy, I felt relief only after a month, but the relief lasted longer and longer and the pain was less.
