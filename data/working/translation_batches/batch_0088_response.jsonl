She never trivialized anything, is always very meticulous, and most importantly, her diagnoses and treatment methods have always worked. Besides, she has a wonderful rapport with children.

The medical part of the mission was conducted under the auspices of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences (UMP), as part of the newly established unit - the Laboratory of Extreme Medicine. During the simulation, special devices were used to recreate the conditions that might exist on space stations on Mars and the Moon.

The visit didn't even last 5 minutes, the doctor looked into the throat, recommended his own cryosurgery, and practically thanked me for the visit. I had to ask myself why this method should help me, what it involves, and what the benefits of the procedure are. So I left only with an invitation to a very expensive procedure, which I can't decide on yet for financial reasons. And paying 120zł for an ENT consultation, I expected the doctor to look not only into the throat but also the nose and ears, conduct a thorough interview, propose different treatment methods, and choose the optimal one together with the patient. If cryosurgery is the only effective solution, one should say why, but also be interested in whether the patient can actually afford it. If not, then even prescribing something for gargling would have been a good justification for charging the fee. Because I didn't get any tangible benefits from the visit - I even read about cryosurgery myself earlier on the Internet. This comment should have a poor, or even very poor, rating.", "redacted": 0}

In the case of 4 people, no improvement was recorded, meaning the disease progressed at the same rate as before the administration of stem cells. Prof. Jan Kowalski's team is the first in the country to announce such research results, and the achieved effects are comparable to those obtained by scientists dealing with the treatment of ALS with stem cells in Italy, Israel, or the United States. In those countries, trials were conducted on a similar number of patients.
