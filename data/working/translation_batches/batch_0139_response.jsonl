Follow-up in 2 months. I hope everything will be okay. If not, I won't be discouraged either, because you usually have to start with treatment that may help but isn't too radical.

The doctor wanted to issue a referral to the hospital for removal of the palatine tonsils. Pressed with questions, she admitted that she saw no indications for such a procedure, but would give the referral just to \"be safe.\" Examination of the third tonsil is not performed at all (because it's better to diagnose \"by eye\"). She looks into both ears with the same disposable instrument - contrary to hygiene and safety rules. I do not recommend! I am updating my opinion - my son actually had an enlarged third tonsil, not the palatine tonsils, and has already undergone adenotomy (with a referral from another doctor). Instead of properly treating chronic sinusitis with antibiotics and referring for adenotomy, the doctor prescribed homeopathic drops (these are not legally considered drugs!!!!) and kept wanting to rinse the sinuses of a 3-year-old, but not with an antibiotic solution, just with a regular saline solution. Such treatment did no good, it only worsened the condition, and before the tonsil removal, the child underwent a solid antibiotic therapy. For 3 months now, no runny nose, no snoring, but that's thanks to other doctors.", "redacted": 0}

I've been going to the doctor for several years, it has never happened that a visit was shorter than 15-20 minutes. In most cases, the visit drags on, which causes long waits to see the doctor. Every patient I've talked to in the waiting room praises the doctor, and in most cases, no one complained about long waits or that visits last 3 minutes - that's some nonsense!!!! It's true that the doctor doesn't examine me every time, but why should she if I don't report any concerning symptoms to her. My visits to the doctor are every 2-3 weeks, and why should she examine me every time. I had a Pap smear once a year, every 6 months (or more often if needed) I have a vaginal cleanliness test done. Currently, I'm halfway through my pregnancy, and the doctor herself suggested that I come to her at Madalińskiego because why should I pay for every visit and tests when the hospital will do it for me under the National Health Fund. Before pregnancy, I had a series of other tests done that allowed checking my health status. There are several women I've talked to about the doctor, and each one says they've never met a doctor who cares so much about pregnancy or getting pregnant as Dr. Anna Kowalska. Going to this woman, I feel that she cares about this pregnancy as much as I do. And I must add that I have a difficult, even very difficult pregnancy. If someone doesn't like the doctor's approach, go to another doctor. It's never the case that every patient likes a given doctor, but think twice before you slander some doctor.", "redacted": 2}

Shift work increases the risk of sleep disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases.

This possibility is being investigated by Dr. Joanna Panecka from the Center for New Technologies at the University of Warsaw, in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg and the Institute for Theoretical Studies in Heidelberg. As the researcher explains, trypanosomes, depending on the species, cause acute, often fatal infections in humans such as: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis; or chronic diseases, e.g., Chagas disease. Symptoms vary: from excessive excitability, fever, swollen lymph nodes to mental disorders and serious damage to internal organs. Leishmaniasis is called white leprosy due to the similarity of skin symptoms to leprosy, and chronic Chagas disease causes damage to the heart and digestive tract.", "redacted": 1}

Jan often thought for a long time about what to say and searched for words. I'm sure the meeting would have gone much more smoothly in Polish.

Surgeries performed on children in the mother's womb until the end of the second trimester of pregnancy leave no traces, whereas when the child is operated on in the following weeks of pregnancy, scars are already visible. Interestingly, the redirection from scarless healing to scarring coincides with the activation of the Foxn1 gene - the \"scar gene.\" Current research in the Laboratory of Regenerative Biology may in the future enable the treatment of non-healing wounds, e.g., in diabetics. They may also support the treatment of patients whose wounds leave extensive, mobility-limiting, or disfiguring scars.", "redacted": 1}

After filling out a questionnaire about diseases and allergies (by the way, it was the first time I filled out something like that at a dentist) he got to work. The assistant also watched over me.

{"opinion_id": "op_002777", "lang": "en", "text": "Parthenogenesis, i.e., virgin birth, occurs in nature in many invertebrates, e.g., rotifers, nematodes, mites, crustaceans, or insects (e.g., bees, wasps, stick insects, beetles). It is also observed among some vertebrates: reptiles (including monitor lizards, geckos), amphibians (some frogs) or fish (e.g., a certain species of sharks or in guppies). As for mammals, parthenogenesis does not occur in nature. \"But scientists are already managing to induce it in laboratory conditions. It is already possible to obtain embryos of young mammals with genetic material from two mothers or from two fathers,\" says Katarzyna Klimczewska, a PhD student from the Department of Embryology at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Warsaw, in an interview with PAP. The researcher recounts that over a decade ago, the mouse Kaguya was born, whose parents were two mothers. For the birth of this mouse to be possible, scientists had to precisely understand what happens in a fertilized cell, and especially which genes are expressed and when. It turns out that for the proper development of a human embryo, the simultaneous presence of male and female genomes is necessary. The paternal genome is responsible for the early development of the placenta, while the maternal one is for the development of the embryo. The lack of genes from the father leads to abnormal placenta development and embryo death. Conversely, the lack of genes from the mother means the embryo's development is delayed and ends in death. However, scientists managed to bypass this problem using genetic modifications. For the development of parthenogenetic embryos to be possible, one of the two maternal genomes had to possess epigenetic modifications characteristic of the paternal genome. Thanks to this mechanism, embryos lacking genetic material from the father could develop.", "redacted": 1}
