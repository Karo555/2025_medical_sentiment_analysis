{"opinion_id": "op_002604", "lang": "en", "text": "In my research, I am trying to answer the question of why humans have five-fingered hands and feet. Because it's not at all obvious - says Prof. Jan Kowalski from the University of Leuven in Belgium and the Medical University of Lublin in an interview with PAP. He reminds that, for example, a chicken's leg has four toes, but in the wing of this bird there are only three. On the other hand, a horse has only one toe per limb. \"Today on Earth, there is no naturally occurring animal that has more than five toes on one limb\" - informs the researcher and emphasizes that it wasn't always like this - when animals came onto land about 380 million years ago, they sometimes had more toes, e.g., nine or more on one limb. However, in modern species, when there are more than five toes, it is considered a genetic defect - so-called polydactyly. \"If our survival depended on six fingers, I am sure we would have had them long ago, and the five-fingered would have died out. However, apparently the sixth finger does not provide a survival advantage\" - comments the researcher.", "redacted": 1}

Regarding my condition, he stated that I should go to a pregnancy pathology clinic, and when I asked if he still practices in Bielany, he firmly denied working there... When asked if he would give me a sick leave, he laughed at me, because he said nothing was wrong with me, but I really felt bad and moreover, I had a serious abdominal surgery. The doctor supposedly has an endocrinology specialization, but he didn't even ask about TSH, even though I've had hypothyroidism since childhood. He wasn't even interested in increasing the hormone dose, which when I later went to an endocrinologist, the female doctor was astonished and immediately increased my thyroid medication dose.

The MRI result I provided was commented as exaggerated. The doctor himself checked the image saved on the CD and stated that he practically doesn't see what's in the description and that my problem is not serious at all, which greatly surprised me, because I experience back pain daily. The occasional severe pain in the lumbar region, which even leads to movement blockage, was not explained to me in any way, or at least that's the impression I got. The doctor recommended physical activity and possibly rehabilitation. Impression after the visit - I know something, but probably only because I had to ask what various terms from the MRI description mean. It seems to me that during a paid visit, the doctor should explain the cause of the pain to the patient more thoroughly. Right now, I only know that if I engage in physical activity, my condition won't worsen.

He dismissed many things while simultaneously trying to care for the patient. Generally a nice appearance but as a doctor he disappointed me greatly.
