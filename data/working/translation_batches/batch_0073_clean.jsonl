{"opinion_id": "op_001442", "text": "Unfortunately, despite many good comments here, I have to give the worst possible opinion: ( this doctor unfortunately does not rely on test results. He didn't even order them for me, which is why he treated me incorrectly the whole time and I wasn't improving. So he decided to admit me to the hospital and take a sample of my cerebrospinal fluid. Maybe he needed a guinea pig for his classes with students... When I came to him with tests that another doctor had sent me for, he just scoffed, saying they were clouding the picture. And the matter was obvious, but the results didn't fit his earlier assumptions... It's not worth talking about, maybe he helped others, but if a doctor's own ego, his own \"intuition\" is more important than a reliable approach to the problem, then no thank you. Avoid him from a distance if you have a serious problem!! Best regards", "lang": "en"}

For several years, I had been treated for acne by various dermatologists; everyone always prescribed antibiotics, but after stopping the medication, everything returned. The doctor prescribed me custom-made ointments, after which the acne practically disappeared (after just a week of application, an incredible difference). The downside is the significant time delay (I was admitted 40 minutes later than my scheduled time - a private visit) and despite having an appointment time, I had to wait. Perhaps this is because the doctor gives each patient as much time as they need. Overall, I recommend :]", "lang": "en"}

This is the first time I've had such a problem and the first time I've been to a vein surgeon. The visit with the doctor lasted literally 3 minutes. Quick Doppler, the doctor mumbled something under his breath, so I had to ask him to repeat it. I didn't really learn anything. Only that I have varicose veins, but not for surgery. But what next, how to prevent it, nothing. There was no time for questions because there were 5 patients waiting behind the door (who are scheduled \"every 5 minutes\").

{"opinion_id": "op_001446", "text": "RAT OPTIMISTS AND PESSIMISTS Dr. Rygu≈Ça explains that it has only been known since recently (2004) how to study optimism and pessimism in rats. The rodents are taught to respond to sounds: high and low. When a high sound appears, the animal must press a lever on the left side to receive a reward. If the rat hears a low sound, it must press the right lever to avoid punishment. \"When the rodents have learned this, we play them an intermediate sound - between high and low. Optimism can be measured by observing how rats assess an ambiguous signal. An optimistic rat will react as if it is going to get a reward. And a pessimistic one - as if it is going to get punished,\" explains the researcher.", "lang": "en"}

I came to him with a serious radial nerve palsy (Saturday night palsy - dropped wrist, lack of finger extensor function). An EMG test showed damage of the neurapraxia/axonotmesis type, and a neurologist estimated that the first muscle activity would appear about 9 months after the injury. The first meeting with Jan took place about 1.5 months after the injury, and after it, the first improvement appeared. With each subsequent meeting, it only got better. After 10 sessions, the hand returned to full functionality! Many months before the predicted recovery of function. Jan has a very positive approach to the patient and provides valuable advice. He also cares about the patient's opinion, which makes therapy an effective collaboration and leads to rapid health improvement.", "lang": "en"}
{"opinion_id": "op_001448", "text": "Scientists have long known that the human brain adapts after injuries or loss of sight. \"The visual cortex of blind people loses its primary occupation, but it does not remain idle, as it switches to, for example, tactile reading and language memory,\" says Dr. Szwed. Until now, it was only guessed that such reprogramming is also possible in fully able individuals, but there was a lack of concrete evidence. Only simple studies were conducted, concerning the plasticity of the tactile cortex, during which subjects practiced distinguishing velvet from velour or corduroy. \"For the first time in history, we are able to show that such large-scale reorganization can occur in the brain of an adult, healthy person,\" he emphasizes. According to Dr. Szwed, other parts of the brain may reorganize in a similar way, not just the visual and tactile cortex. \"One scientist showed his subjects a video of piano keys being pressed, but without sound. In non-pianists watching the film, the visual cortex was activated, possibly the motor cortex, because they imagined what it would be like to move their fingers. Meanwhile, in professional pianists, the auditory cortex was also active, even though they heard nothing,\" Dr. Szwed described in an interview with PAP.", "lang": "en"}

Throughout the two years, the treatment proceeded correctly, appointments were always on time, there was never a delay or rescheduling.

Prices ranged between 140-230 PLN; I never knew how much to prepare for. My last two visits took place contrary to the information given earlier and ultimately cost me 150 PLN more than I was previously informed, even though I specifically asked about the cost several times...

Since the market for \"eco\" or \"bio\" products is still developing, consumers face traps and hooks they should be aware of. According to the expert, an example of \"greenwashing\" could be, for instance, the actions of an energy company that communicates that its energy is ecological and clean, when in fact this \"ecologicality\" concerns only 1-2% of all energy produced. \"Here we see a discrepancy, when still 98% of the energy is from conventional sources,\" she added.", "lang": "en"}

The surgery went without any complications (I didn't have any drains, bruises like girls sometimes describe here with other doctors). Dr. Jan is a very nice person, and the whole staff is super. I chose the doctor because my friend had breast augmentation with him 7 years ago and has beautiful results and is very satisfied. Whatever I want to do in the future or anyone close to me, it will only be with Dr. Jan Kowalski, because he is 100% trustworthy. Girls and women, don't wonder whether to get breast augmentation or not, just if you have too small or none like I had 75A and now it's 75C! and a big C! decide!

{"opinion_id": "op_001460", "text": "\"Such self-treatment is unacceptable,\" warned Prof. Anna Kowalska. Antibiotics should only be used with a doctor's knowledge, yet 5-10% of patients take them on their own. Moreover, patients do not take these medications as they should, i.e., in the appropriate dose, at a specified time, and for the recommended duration. If they don't do this, the concentration of the drug in the body is too low, some bacteria survive and acquire resistance. Experts admitted that doctors are not without blame, as they too often yield to pressure from patients demanding an effective antibiotic. As a result, they are often prescribed unnecessarily for viral infections, which they don't work on, such as colds and flu and sore throat. Only 15% of adults with upper respiratory tract infections have indications for antibiotic use, yet as many as 70% of patients receive them.", "lang": "en"}
