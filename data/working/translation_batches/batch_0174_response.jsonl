{"opinion_id": "op_003461", "lang": "en", "text": "Hello :) My husband has a very serious problem with his spine, he has two herniated discs at 4mm and 8mm, the doctor said that my husband has the spine of a 50-year-old, but he is only 35. Two doctors, an orthopedist and a neurosurgeon, recommend surgery! We now have a big dilemma about what to do? Because we are very afraid of surgery, our family advises against it, but my husband's suffering is great. We have a question: what implants are good after disc removal? Is Dr. Jan a reliable, good doctor? And please write approximately how much such an operation might cost? Thank you very much in advance. ANNA", "redacted": 2}

She got me back on my feet and made me develop a friendship with my daughter (and she is the most important person in the world). The world and people around me changed. There are no computers, no notes in the office. All attention is directed to our conversation. We laugh together, and sometimes we cry together. Thanks to our meetings, I am starting to notice myself and fight for myself. Probably a long road is still ahead of me, but I know that with Anna, I will manage everything.", "redacted": 2}

I waited with the opinion because I wanted to be sure that it would be a true opinion, not just one \"for the moment\". So today, from a perspective of time, I can highly recommend meetings with Anna. Everything took place in a nice, friendly atmosphere. During the meetings, I felt support and incredible empathy. I came to the first visit weak, resigned, and not needed by anyone. After a few meetings, and now also after a few months that have passed since those meetings, I can only thank for the help and unlocking my \"drawers\". My life has changed â€“ of course for the better. Now I know what I need to do to take care of Myself and never forget about Myself.", "redacted": 2}
