I came for the first time with severe symptoms of dizziness and numbness in my limbs. After a 10-minute interview, Dr. Anna Kowalska referred me to physiotherapy, which the specialist did not want to undertake due to the nature of my symptoms. I returned for another visit to Dr. Anna Kowalska, and she again stated that there were no indications for further tests and that physiotherapy would be sufficient due to muscle tension.", "redacted": 2}
