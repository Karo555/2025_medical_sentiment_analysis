Dr. Jan Kowalski referred me for surgery, which according to later consultations with a surgeon and an orthopedist had no chance of success. It was supposed to involve breaking a bone that was 2mm in size and sewing it (or its fragments) back together! From information from doctors I consulted, it appears that Dr. Jan Kowalski often refers people for such dangerous operations. If I hadn't consulted this doctor's decision at the department in Piekary, I would probably be disabled today. DO NOT RECOMMEND.", "redacted": 2}

Jan Kowalski. Existing tools for comprehensive profiling of proteolytic enzymes have so far relied solely on natural amino acids found in proteins. To achieve better results, the Wrocław team of Dr. Jan Kowalski used unnatural amino acids, which are not encoded by DNA and mostly originated from organic synthesis. A hybrid (containing natural and unnatural amino acids) library of fluorogenic substrates (HyCoSuL) was created. \"Thanks to this tool, we are able to create new, more sensitive substrates and chemical markers for a very large group of proteolytic enzymes\" - explained Dr. Jan Kowalski.", "redacted": 3}

{"opinion_id": "op_002245", "lang": "en", "text": "Meanwhile, a team from American universities Stanford and California, as well as from Kraków's AGH, is working on making future implants allow for more precise vision. Researchers want the implant to use much smaller electrodes that will be densely packed - instead of several dozen electrodes, it will be possible to place even several thousand on the retina. This will make the image more detailed. Additionally, researchers want impulses from one electrode to be very precise and reach individual ganglion cells, not thousands at once. Another challenge is improving the impulses that the electrode sends to the retinal cell. \"What we see at any moment is a very complex scene. It's hard for us to encode it the way the eye does\" - the scientist explains. He explains that there are up to 20 different types of ganglion cells in the retina - different cells are responsible for, e.g., processing and sending information about color to the brain, and others about movement. So if you stimulate an entire area of retinal cells, you stimulate different types simultaneously, which may cause the brain to receive conflicting signals at once.", "redacted": 0}

The clinic is in a Western style. Nice decor, inspiring trust - actually convincing of professionalism. The girls who work there, led by the boss, are smiling all the time - which might seem artificial - but that didn't bother me, because I like to smile myself. It might only be irritating for people who are perpetually dissatisfied with life or, as someone wrote, factory-dissatisfied. The visit dispelled my doubts and I got answers to all my questions. I was also informed there that during the approximately 2-year treatment, it might change, meaning additional appliances might be used - hence, increased costs. And the same can be read in the treatment contract. I suggest to those who accuse this woman of taking their money to simply read the contract carefully. I did not decide on treatment at Orthosmile precisely because of the high costs. I said goodbye to them in a very pleasant atmosphere, collected my documentation, and went to a clinic I can afford. The orthodontic market in Wrocław is quite broad, and we therefore have a choice. So think before starting treatment anywhere you go and read contracts carefully. And as for Vice's post - you're no man if you can write so offensively about a woman. Well, unless you're a jealous and boiling-with-anger woman... \"factory-dissatisfied\" in every area. I saw the female doctor twice, but girls, more than one of us would like to look like her - I quote Vice - \"a dolled-up doctor and an aging woman\" : ) Greetings", "redacted": 0}

Some believe that a rat can suffer from depression - others that it's nonsense. But we have models that significantly resemble what characterizes depression in humans.

So those with depression stop caring about fun, meetings with friends, good food, or sex. And scientists from IF PAN specialize in modeling similar anhedonia in animals.

Once, my son (3 years old) got spots on his face, she decided it was a toxic-allergic rash, prescribed a lot of steroids and strong ointments, plus Pulmeo which was completely inappropriate in that case; one could get the impression that my son was seriously ill; I gave him ordinary calcium for two days for this \"toxic syndrome\" and the allergy went away as if by magic. Anyway, that's not the only interesting diagnosis from this female doctor; I was with her a total of 3 times, when my son was almost a year old he also got Zyrtec for some minor problem, of course in a horse dose just in case, I didn't give the Zyrtec, the child is fine.

He treated me for 4 months with expensive medications and supposedly I am healthy. I've had all possible tests. He stuffed me with medications, without result. As of today, I have a cyst again and I am not qualified for surgery. And yesterday when I pressed him, he told me that the best solution would be IVF. After that, I left the office crying. I did the tests he ordered, but I don't know if I'll even go there. And if I go, it will probably be for the photocopy of the test results, probably it's high time to change doctors.

{"opinion_id": "op_002255", "lang": "en", "text": "My partner and I came to the doctor to confirm an early pregnancy. It was the holiday period, I had spotting, and we were far from home and my doctor. Unfortunately, during the examination, the doctor did not find an embryo (30 days from transfer). He was very empathetic and tactful, certainly understanding what it meant for us after 5 years of infertility treatment and the first pregnancy. We were devastated. Fortunately, 3 days later my doctor found the embryo and a beating heart. Dr. Jan Kowalski did not inform us about the proper corpus luteum (on the ultrasound it was measured as a gestational sac and measured externally, not internally), which however gives great hope for a normal pregnancy, and that would have been important information for us as it gives hope for a proper embryo. The male doctor also used Doppler during the examination, although as he admitted, it shouldn't be used at this stage of pregnancy. I hope it didn't harm our pregnancy. EDIT: unfortunately, we ultimately lost the pregnancy in the 10th week. And two more remarks. The visit started with a comment that the doctor doesn't like the presence of partners during a gynecological examination - I haven't encountered such a comment in 5 years, and my partner, due to our years of infertility treatment, often accompanies me in the office and I think it was an unprofessional comment. During the visit, there is always a moment when you can tactfully ask the partner to leave the office, you don't have to do it in the first sentence right after the couple enters the office. Secondly, I had a rather painful gynecological examination which in my opinion was completely unnecessary since I came for an ultrasound. The doctor did not inform me why this examination was needed, nor that it would hurt. I think it was unnecessary, especially since I reported an early pregnancy and spotting. I consider this a significant minus of the visit.", "redacted": 1}
