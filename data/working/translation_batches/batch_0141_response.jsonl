The female doctor is nice and pleasant, but I will not go to her again because 2 out of 3 scheduled visits did not take place (and they were canceled at the last minute or the day before). If someone has time to schedule like that, I recommend it because the female doctor certainly knows her profession well. Of course, the visit ended with the purchase of glasses. I only learned about the diagnosis and recommendations when picking up the glasses because the clinic has such a division of duties that the receptionists read the patient's file and convey everything to them (unless they forget, as in my case).", "redacted": 0}

This year, several operations have already been performed in Poland using 3D imaging. Surgeons from University Hospital No. 1 im. Jurasza in Bydgoszcz operated on a hernia and gallbladders in this way. At the provincial hospital at ul.

So when a skin keratinization appeared under the little one's collarbone, lasting for several weeks, we went again. After describing the problem, I asked if it might be some atopic dermatitis or something similar because I had seen it before and it looked similar. Mr. Jan Kowalski pretended not to hear and began to examine the skin change. After my repeated question, he stated with full certainty that it was not atopic dermatitis but a mole that appeared on its own - just like that. He added that nothing could be done about it. However, he prescribed about 4 specialized preparations for washing and applying. I asked why, since according to him nothing would help. In response, he gave me a lecture that \"after all, I come for advice to an expert, and he considers it advisable\" and that \"he explains less to his students than to me.\" Disgusted by this visit, we decided to ignore his recommendations and used exactly the same cosmetics as before. After 2 months, there was no trace of the \"mole\" that was supposed to last a lifetime! Professor Jan Kowalski made the diagnosis quite uncertainly, as if he did not fully trust his eyesight. He also forgot that he had already asked something or said something, and moreover, he confused the names of the preparations. When going there, you must additionally expect to be treated like a student - the professor expects something from you (e.g., saying what he wants and only when he wants). You can at most (but quietly) hope, not expect. I advise thinking twice before booking an appointment.", "redacted": 2}
