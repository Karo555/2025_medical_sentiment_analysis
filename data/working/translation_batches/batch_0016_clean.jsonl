With Dr. Jan Kowalski, the trying lasted about 9 months, and after another 9 our little daughter appeared!

We have already signed a cooperation agreement with the Cancer Genetics Laboratory in Toru≈Ñ for studies on patients diagnosed with breast cancer.

We know from genetic studies conducted by the mentioned laboratory that there are changes in the genome in patients at risk and already ill with cancer. A certain gene mutation occurs in their genome.

{"opinion_id": "op_000309", "text": "Prof. Jan Kowalski added that creating something like a genetic portrait of cancer already translates into treatment possibilities for certain groups of patients using so-called molecularly targeted therapies. Scientists hope that in the future these possibilities will be even broader. The action of molecularly targeted drugs involves blocking the faulty protein that arises as a result of a given mutation or genetic change. Its activity leads to uncontrolled multiplication of cancer cells. These drugs are much more selective than classical chemotherapy and often significantly prolong patients' lives. \"We have examples of patients who would have lived at most 6-9 months, and now live 2-3 years, work, lead active lives\" - said Prof. Jan Kowalski. He added that there are also other examples of targeted drugs whose effectiveness is much lower.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_000311", "text": "I've been fighting cancer for almost 3 years. I think that probably every patient (in a similar situation) goes to the doctor with their heart in their mouth. After a stay and another biopsy at the hospital (ul. Paderewskiego 4) the doctor referred me for a consultation to Dr. Jan Kowalski. After familiarizing himself with the medical history and examining me, he said briefly: \"let those who started the treatment finish it\" and sent me back to the doctor from whom I came. I interpreted it as: it's very bad with you, so I don't feel like bothering with this - go back where you came from. And how does this relate to, somewhat earlier expressed by Anna's opinion, i.e. \"...has very good relations with other specialists, which is important for the patient, because cooperation between doctors is often decisive\"? The next day I had to go to him and pick up my documentation. He didn't utter a single word of explanation, not to mention a word \"sorry\". Apparently Dr. Jan Kowalski wasn't taught in school what empathy is. In any case, he certainly missed his calling. When treating privately he may behave differently, but in my eyes he completely disqualified himself. I definitely do not recommend.", "lang": "en"}

My child was operated on by him: tonsillectomy and ear drainage. Unfortunately, Dr. Jan Kowalski also takes money for a post-operative visit and forgets to tell his patients that in the case of ear drains, you need to schedule an appointment to remove them right after the operation because the waiting time in the NHS is so long. Instead, he invites for a private procedure, the cost of which is again about 1100, and another 250 for a visit just before the removal.

Quick superficial diagnosis, it would seem that for everything the same medicine and everyone suffers from the same thing. At least in my eyes diagnosis also depends largely on the initial interview with the patient. At least then you know what e.g. is happening or what messed up in my case. For medications I paid 200 z≈Ç... And nothing helped, in fact it worsened my condition both physically and mentally. I unfortunately cannot recommend this gentleman But maybe I'm some kind of exception or such a situation just happened to me For too cynical an attitude and lack of engagement in the matter unfortunately minus...
