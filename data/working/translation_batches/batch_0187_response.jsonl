I have never met such a rude, such an angry doctor who lacked minimal normal communication skills. We are refugees from Ukraine and maybe that's why this woman was so unpleasant to us, or maybe she is just a very unpleasant person in general. Either way, I cried on the way home because the entire meeting was pure horror and stress. During the visit, me and my husband, the biological father of the child, felt like spoiled students. The doctor either mocked us, made sharp, ironic remarks, or grabbed her head and lamented: \"God, how you ruined this child, how bad everything is\". And all this, mind you, with the child present! Then she incorrectly commented on the fact that the child doesn't live with the mother, and we had to explain why anyway. Although this is absolutely none of her business. There are no words to describe the whole situation, but we will be under terrible stress for a very long time.", "redacted": 0}
