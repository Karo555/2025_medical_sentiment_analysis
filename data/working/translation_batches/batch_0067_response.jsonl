The atmosphere in the office is fantastic, you can relax while looking at beautiful landscapes displayed on the ceiling. The ladies at the reception are very friendly and helpful. As for Dr. Anna, I probably don't need to mention, she's amazing, competent, and a pleasant woman. I recommend the office to everyone. Greetings to the entire staff.

She has an individual approach to the patient, which is very important in long-term treatment. I fondly remember the treatment with Dr. Anna.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_001323", "lang": "en", "text": "I am very sorry for your loss. However, in your statement, you do not present any problems or symptoms that were troubling you and that you brought to the doctor's attention during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any complaints, I am convinced they would not have been left without the doctor's response. In reality, one can conclude that the pregnancy at the time of the visit did not raise any concerns for the doctor. The doctor, in accordance with the course of the pregnancy, prescribed vitamins and ordered a list of tests that you should have done immediately and then returned for another visit. You do not mention how long after the tests were done, whether everything was okay, and when you returned to the doctor. One can only conclude that you did not have a visit for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is monitoring the development of the fetus, whether it is developing according to the accepted stages, and you should know that yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, which is actually the 6th week from conception, such an early stage of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to detect the embryo's heartbeat. At a later date, the heart's rudiment should be visible, and the heartbeat should be detectable on the ultrasound image. You do not mention what the doctor said during your ultrasound, whether he had any doubts about the examination and the proper development of the embryo. Everything indicates that in your case it was still too early to confirm the heartbeat, and the accusations you present are somewhat misplaced and exaggerated before the histopathological examination diagnosis. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately increasingly common that the embryo stops developing at some point due to various reasons, such as a genetic defect or hormonal deficiencies, etc. In such a situation, you should have experienced some symptoms, such as fever, bleeding, or lower abdominal pain, which you also do not mention. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus as a foreign body, and at least a fever should occur. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant in the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day to ask if you have done the tests and how you are feeling; definitely more interest in the pregnancy should lie on your side. Once again, I am very sorry and wish you luck, as well as familiarizing yourself with literature and proper preparation for the next pregnancy.", "redacted": 0}

According to the Vice-Rector, projects arising at the intersection of research and development centers and industry have a chance for funding amounting to tens of millions of zlotys, while scientific research alone can count on support of several hundred thousand zlotys. \"It is so important to shorten the path between research and its implementation,\" she added.", "redacted": 1}

In urgent situations, there is a possibility to contact Dr. Anna Kowalska; she does not downplay reported problems. During the visit, she conducts the examination in detail, explaining everything carefully. She answers any questions exhaustively. The visits took place in an atmosphere of safety.

The pain I experienced non-stop for many weeks, where every step, every movement of the foot was painful, made me able to endure the unpleasant sensations of the procedure.

{"opinion_id": "op_001331", "lang": "en", "text": "The specialist claims that the dispute over what to spread on bread - butter or margarine - has a long tradition, going far back into the past. It began already in the pre-war years when margarine production increased. Its name comes from the Greek word 'margaritari,' which means pearl, because initially it looked like a pearly mass. Prof. Anna Kowalska believes that the mistake in all discussions is that there is no clear answer to the question of what to use: butter or margarine. \"It depends on for whom the menu is being prepared,\" she emphasizes. As an example, she gives people who are overweight or obese, who should be on a diet to reduce body weight. \"Usually, they are advised to stop spreading bread because it is the simplest way to reduce the daily energy intake,\" she adds.", "redacted": 1}

There were visits where she answered questions, had time, and was very nice, but there were also times when the examination lasted a moment, she gave the impression that she was working here as a punishment, and I was just an intruder... she would answer the phone during the visit and talk privately, though I think she is at work and shouldn't do that... we are only human and have the right to have bad days, but we also need to respect the other person, because that's what personal culture and professionalism require, in my opinion.

During later meetings, the interview is collected fragmentarily (meeting max. 20-25 min.) and practically entirely relies on the therapist's notes (not on the patient's report regarding well-being and medication effects). Dr. Anna definitely has a lot to improve in her practice. I recommend choosing another doctor!", "redacted": 1}

The worst thing he could do was to inform me, and I quote: 'oh, ma'am, I don't see any chance of you having a child here - a cactus would grow sooner than you getting pregnant' - I should add that I am 28 years old, Dr. Jan told me this just before my wedding, for me it was a tragedy. It's good that I quickly got references to another endocrinologist and gynecologist, who worked together throughout the year, their task was to help me get pregnant and manage it properly. Dr. Jan Kowalski stated that my gynecologist is stupid and doesn't know anything and is not a miracle worker to get me pregnant. I should add that changing doctors from Dr. Jan Kowalski to another endocrinologist turned out to be the best decision of my life - I now have a 2-month-old beautiful daughter.....

Maybe as a doctor she is good, I don't know, but as a person, she is not very communicative, and a person working in the medical profession should not be like that.
