The goal was to quickly identify active changes in the EEG recording heralding the onset of epileptogenesis. The researchers also proposed anti-epileptic treatment at this stage, even before epilepsy occurs. This was a completely new approach. In 2011, they published the results of a study involving 45 children with tuberous sclerosis in the journal 'European Journal of Pediatric Neurology'. The study showed that administering anti-epileptic drugs before the onset of seizures significantly reduces the risk of intellectual disability in children. In the treated group, the percentage of children with intellectual disability was 14%, while in the control group, i.e., treated only when epilepsy symptoms occurred, it was 48%. According to Prof. Jan Kowalski, the new therapeutic approach completely changes the prognosis for affected children.", "redacted": 1}

At the first visit, which lasted 10 minutes (with ultrasound), she quickly read my questionnaire, printed out recommendations, and said I needed to calm down because peace and relaxation are most important during pregnancy. She absolutely should not have taken folic acid, and in the recommendations, she listed, among others: 1) cod liver oil (which contains vitamin A, which in large quantities is absolutely not recommended during pregnancy!!!) 2) raspberry leaf infusion (recommended, but in the final weeks of pregnancy to relax the cervix) 3) doing a glucose tolerance test...

{"opinion_id": "op_000829", "lang": "en", "text": "All my predecessors write about Ms. Anna Kowalska after a meeting in a private proctology office. I, however, met with Dr. Anna Kowalska at a health center where she saw patients as a surgeon. I had a painful hemorrhoidal lump the size of a plum and an indescribable pain. After examining the ailment, the Doctor said that in a public facility she doesn't have the tools and the only thing she can do is a rectoscopy. I was very surprised because every patient who presents with pain and inflammation should be treated to first eliminate that pain and inflammation. I asked for medication and pain relief with drugs. To this, Dr. Anna Kowalska repeated twice more that she could only perform a painful rectoscopy and not on the day of the visit, but after special preparation in two days. I didn't give up and started asking, disappointed, what I should do then. She recommended a visit to a proctologist in a private office, not necessarily with her. I asked for the Doctor's business card and made an appointment the same day at her office. I asked once more about pain relief and only then received proper advice. I might have gone to that visit, but the amount of 200 zł a few years ago was unacceptable to me. Besides, I didn't like how I was treated. Dear people, she didn't help me at all!!! She didn't prescribe me anything. She threatened me with a painful rectoscopy - me, a person writhing in pain from inflammation and an unbearably troublesome lump. The same day, before me, a young girl who had hemorrhoidal complications after childbirth went in to see this Doctor. She came out crying. The Doctor told her that her ailments could lead to cancer, and the frightened girl sat in front of the office for a while longer. I don't know if the Doctor spoke to her the same way as with me. I suspect maybe so. I give Dr. Anna Kowalska the worst rating not for her medical skills, which I don't know, but for her inhuman treatment of the patient.", "redacted": 3}

Another Dentist took me urgently with this pain - it turned out that pressure was building under the filling, causing it. The tooth ultimately had to be root canal treated. Second remark: the Doctor's assistant works with patients despite having a cold, runny nose, and cough. For me, this is appalling. Additionally, she kept talking to the Doctor the whole time, constantly distracting her. Last remark: the Doctor assessed practically most of my teeth as needing treatment. The second Dentist, who saved me from pain, fixed only 2 of my teeth, and after these few months, it's still okay. He did not assess the remaining teeth as necessary for fillings. Perhaps he simply has a different approach. I cannot say that the Doctor was wrong. I leave the conclusions to the Reader. Visit price: 170 zł. Set for 45 minutes and not a moment more.
