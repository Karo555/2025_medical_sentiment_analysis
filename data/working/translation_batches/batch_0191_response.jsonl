{"opinion_id": "op_003803", "lang": "en", "text": "I came to Dr. Jan Kowalski after an unsatisfactory visit with another neurologist. I didn't know then that I had experienced panic attacks. Fortunately, thanks to the accurate diagnosis and the doctor's commitment, these were my first and hopefully last such episodes. After several visits and tests, Dr. Jan Kowalski suspected neurosis and recommended a psychiatric consultation. For five months, I have been under psychiatric care and can honestly say that I haven't felt better in many years. I am immensely grateful for the doctor's professionalism, empathy, and accurate insights.", "redacted": 1}

Thank you.", "redacted": 0}

She didn't even look at the disc! Every specialist like a neurologist or orthopedist should not rely solely on the description.", "redacted": 0}
