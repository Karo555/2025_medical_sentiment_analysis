Dr. Anna Kowalska is an incredibly empathetic, engaged, patient-focused doctor. I came to her with a rather unusual situation and left with tears of relief in my eyes because she took care of all the needs I had. She listened to my entire medical history, referred to it, collected a detailed interview, took notes, took photos, issued recommendations. I felt that she genuinely cared about helping me, not just physically but also mentally. An approach I unfortunately experience rarely. It's clear that this is a vocation for her, she has enormous knowledge and ease in conveying it in an accessible way. I particularly recommend her to people who have had previous difficult experiences seeking help - Dr. Anna will be medicine not only for the skin but also for the heart.", "redacted": 1}

If needed, I will return to the doctor - for now we're starting treatment. After the visit, the doctor also offers the possibility to ask questions in case of uncertainties or to clarify issues related to \"dosage\". Overall, I rate the online visit 6+.
