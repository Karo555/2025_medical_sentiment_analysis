What does professional competence have to do with the doctor being handsome? Maybe there are women who go to the doctor because, excuse my language, 'they have no one to show themselves to,' but let's not exaggerate, don't say that women are just like that, going to doctors they find attractive! I understand that the doctor didn't meet your expectations and you have the right to a negative opinion, but comments about him being popular or in demand due to his charm are a huge exaggeration to me. By the way - he's not that much of a looker in my opinion - that's my take.", "redacted": 0}

Very long delays (1-1.5 hours), which I was only informed about in the waiting room. During the visit, the doctor was more interested in chatting with the intern. It happened that she put on a different color of elastics than the one I requested. My teeth weren't fully straightened after the braces were removed. It was supposedly due to their 'barrel-shaped' form. I cared about the aesthetic result, but the doctor approached it rather dismissively. I don't consider the treatment to have been successful.", "redacted": 0}

When the visit finally happened, it lasted about 1.5 minutes. Mr. M. printed out a piece of paper with the text 'Recommendation for laser removal' (which everyone already knew about, and my son actually needs that, not a printout) and told us to look for a doctor on the internet. When I pointed out that what he did (a one-and-a-half-minute visit) wasn't worth a hundred zlotys, he took that printed paper from me, but unfortunately, the hundred was gone because my wife had already paid. After that visit, I conclude it's not worth going there. Mr. Moralewicz didn't demonstrate any knowledge in 1.5 minutes, and we essentially paid a hundred for nothing. I do not recommend; he shows no interest in the patient, and my child still walks around with sore legs. I strongly advise against it.", "redacted": 2}

I went to Koszalin with the same results; Dr. Wasilewska said everything was fine, my child was healthy from the start, and Dr. Ciarka was just making up illnesses. At the end, when I wanted to go back to Dr. Ciarka after the visit in Koszalin to compare the diagnoses, he told me he wouldn't see me because I was comparing results with other doctors, and he doesn't appreciate such situations, so I had to choose either him or Dr. Wasilewska. In my opinion, this doctor should retire since he has poor eyesight and doesn't keep up with his education. I ADVISE AGAINST HIM TO EVERYONE!!!", "redacted": 3}

When I disagreed with her opinions, she said I was avoiding the topic. My request to slow down the pace of changes and organize my feelings was evaluated as an attempt to escape. It was difficult to count on Ms. Magdalena's support in crisis situations (I don't mean free support or taking time from another patient), but she had objections to me seeking help from another psychologist. At the end of our collaboration, I heard that Ms. Magdalena wished me all the best, but as she noted a moment later, 'it will be difficult for you to find a therapist who will be able to help you.' That statement probably devastated me the most.

During the check-up after the procedure, the doctor informed me that another surgery was necessary because I hadn't been properly cleaned out. The next day (after a sleepless and tearful night), I went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where the D&C was performed, and after being examined by 2 doctors, it turned out everything was in perfect order. The ultrasound image corresponded to the typical state after such medical intervention, and the accompanying symptoms were also standard. (I'll add that after the ER visit, I also went privately to other doctors who did not confirm Dr. Stec's diagnosis.) Generally, the doctor is polite, tactful, engaged, patient, and I could also count on contact via email. Nevertheless, his erroneous diagnosis was psychologically exhausting for me. At the hospital, I learned that it often happens that doctors 'from the city' don't fully know how the endometrium should/can look after a D&C. It's hard for me to assess this doctor unequivocally, but I decided not to have him manage another pregnancy or cycle monitoring.", "redacted": 1}

I won't hide that during the first visit, I made a joke that since the Doctor had never performed this procedure before, then for the 'first time' he would surely try very hard.

The lady doctor can never be found in the hospital; she's always running, hiding in the doctor's room with all that company.

I feel obliged to post my opinion regarding the work and competence of the gynecologist, and my goal is to warn especially young girls, inexperienced in dealing with doctors. I came to the lady doctor with cycle disorders. I must admit she ordered basic hormone tests for me. I got lutein. Here, unfortunately, the troubles began; the lady doctor clearly had no idea what the nature of my disorder was or how to treat it, aside from being an arrogant person who treats patients in a brusque manner. When problems arose during medication, she was fumbling in the dark, ignored my doubts (e.g., I got my period while taking lutein; it was clear the doctor had no idea why this was happening, whether to stop taking it when bleeding appears or finish the 10 days). Now I know I should have gone to an endocrinologist with my problem, but back then I thought treatment for this type of disorder was standard and a gynecologist could handle it. The catch is that the doctor didn't have the honor to admit she lacked the competence to handle the problem and refer me to another specialist. I lost my nerves during visits and a ton of money, and I hope it doesn't affect my health, because I got the hormone test results back and they are not good.

In this way, I could quickly lose it, and that's probably not the point... She wanted me to take an alternating dose of medication for several months, which I didn't agree to. The only plus was the ultrasound during the visit, which is useful from time to time. An additional bad taste was left by the fact that at the pharmacy I paid 3 times more for the medication than before because the Doctor graciously wrote a 100% payable prescription, knowing that a pack of 2x50 Euthyrox tablets is reimbursed and I would have paid about 6 zł for it as before.
