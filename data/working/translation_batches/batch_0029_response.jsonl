Allergies to soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish also occur. Data presented at the conference show that cow's milk protein allergies are more common in formula-fed children (containing it in infant food formulas).

She did not perform the procedure, did not provide any advice, but we had to pay for the visit. I was misled over the phone about the possibility of performing the procedure, and moreover, the female doctor took money for nothing. However, professional ethics oblige something.

The female doctor prescribed medication, after which I felt excellent. However, as it later turned out - it was the first severe depressive episode in bipolar affective disorder (probably already revealed in high school), which was diagnosed by another doctor. The female doctor is polite and matter-of-fact. If someone expects long conversations about their problems, I suggest going to a doctor who is also a psychotherapist. The only thing I can blame the female doctor for is not recognizing a hypomanic episode in me, into which the medication put me. Everyone around me noticed my unnaturally positive attitude towards life (there were no unsolvable problems for me at that time). Unfortunately, I still feel the negative consequences of decisions made from that period - I blame myself above all for that. At the same time, I believe that the doctor should closely observe the patient's behavior, which unfortunately was lacking in the female doctor.", "redacted": 0}

{"opinion_id": "op_000569", "lang": "en", "text": "Sport has moved forward, results are increasingly +stretched+. Scientists believe that athletes are approaching the physical limits of possibilities. Therefore, the mental sphere constitutes a more interesting area to explore - said in an interview with PAP sports psychologist, Aleksandra Pogorzelska from the School of Higher Social Psychology. - It often happens that we have the same equipment, the same training, the same methods, and yet one athlete can become a world champion, and another is unable to do so. Hence, this mental support can become a fraction of an advantage. It helps athletes integrate what their body has trained with what their head, their mind can do. According to the psychologist, mental training, also called mind training, or psychological skills training, regardless of the sport discipline, has a similar structure - important are, among others, developing goal-setting skills, concentration, building self-confidence, coping with stress, with loss, but also with victory. However, different disciplines require focusing on different mental skills. For example, in technical sports where precision plays a role (e.g., shooting) concentration is practiced in training, while in endurance sports - e.g., race walking or marathon, the ability to achieve long-term goals, endurance will be more important.", "redacted": 1}

Besides, Dr. Jan Kowalski very quickly loses interest in the patient, treats sick people like annoying flies. He is busy because he likes to live at a certain level.

According to Dr. Ewelina Hallmann from the Department of Functional, Ecological and Commodity Food Science at SGGW – absolutely not. Previously, it was recommended not to eat eggs too often. Now, however, it is known that eggs are not as unhealthy as once thought. In the SGGW communication, it was explained that although one hen's egg contains the permissible daily dose of cholesterol, healthy people can safely eat up to three eggs a day. Why? Because cholesterol from eggs is metabolized differently than that produced by our liver, and it will not deposit in our arteries. Occasionally, you can eat even more hen's eggs in one day.", "redacted": 1}
