I was afraid that to lose weight I would have to eat steamed vegetables with rice... Instead, I received an interesting menu full of spices and flavor. I managed to lose weight and improve my health. Ms. Anna is a nice, competent person who knows how to motivate. If you want to lose weight while eating tasty dishes tailored to your taste, I recommend Ms. Anna! Anna", "redacted": 3}

Before every outing, I had to apply huge amounts of concealer around my eyes to hide them... It was my torment. Dr. Jan Kowalski recommended me Carboxytherapy and Light Eyes Ultra treatments. I repeated both treatments several times and I must say the results are fantastic! I see a huge improvement. The skin around my eyes is brightened, and the \"dark circles\" have practically disappeared. Regarding Dr. Jan Kowalski, he is a very friendly and always smiling person. Before starting the treatment, he thoroughly explains what it involves and what results we can expect. I recommend Fabskin to everyone.", "redacted": 1}

She showed me how to eat less but in a way that feels fulfilling culinarily and to see the effect of my work. Of course, a positive effect. Weight down! Ms. Anna's professional approach makes you want to. A bit of self-discipline and the effect is guaranteed. I definitely recommend, even to those who have tried many times. Greetings to Ms. Anna.

{"opinion_id": "op_002426", "lang": "en", "text": "\"Under no circumstances should one conclude from our work that consuming marijuana could be a way to cure anyone of diabetes,\" warns Prof. Jan Kowalski and explains: \"Blood glucose concentration is determined by the balance between the actions of alpha and beta cells in the pancreas and target tissues, such as skeletal muscles or adipose tissue. In an adult, more cannabinoids will force one group of cells to work more intensively, but at the same time weaken the efficiency of the other, and the blood glucose level will not change or may even significantly increase.\" The discovery of the role of cannabinoids in communication between alpha and beta cells brings hope for more effective treatment of diabetes through pancreatic islet transplants. Such transplants can be performed today. For this purpose, a fragment of appropriate tissue is taken from a deceased donor and placed under the gastric mucosa. \"However, the effects are temporary because the beta cells of the implant often lose their previous identity: they still live but stop producing insulin. Since the patient after implantation of foreign tissue must take burdensome immunosuppressive drugs, the harm caused by such therapy often outweighs the benefits,\" reads the statement sent to PAP.", "redacted": 1}

{"opinion_id": "op_002431", "lang": "en", "text": "I do not recommend. At first, the doctor gave a good impression. I visited him a total of 3 times over a year and a half. Basic urine tests detected nothing and despite my polite insistence to deepen the nephrological diagnostics, he insisted that without proteinuria and/or leukocyturia there is no chance that I had kidney inflammation, and it was rather a muscle or spine problem (my nephrological symptoms clearly indicated it was a kidney issue!). After almost two years, I finally found a good doctor who recommended, among other things, an MRI, which left no illusions. The spine is healthy, and in my left kidney I have a segmental diffusion restriction of the renal papilla corresponding to an inflammatory focus. Soon I will have more detailed tests. If Mr. Jan Kowalski had approached my case professionally from the start and wanted to take me seriously, the inflammation would not have turned into a chronic form, which unfortunately cannot be cured... As a consolation, I will only say that most other nephrologists I visited also did not want to examine me, seeing normal basic urine tests.", "redacted": 1}

The problems I struggled with did not disappear, but the way of thinking, the approach to problems is completely different. I admit, I didn't think it could be so good ;) Throughout the therapy period, various problems appeared which were immediately clarified. Ms. Anna doesn't waste time on misunderstandings :) I admit, I had a big problem with lack of assertiveness and setting boundaries. I read many books without much result, but only Ms. Anna herself made me experience what it's all about :) By presenting the rules of cooperation concretely :) I must admit, even when I sometimes crossed these boundaries, I was politely reminded :) This is one of the more valuable lessons for me, it is a hundred times better than reading books and I recommend it to everyone who has such a problem :) As a reliable and active professional. Appropriate approach, various exercises, homework, and in all this, time for an ordinary conversation. In short, I came to therapy like a manipulated pupa, not caring about my space, and I left - flew out like a butterfly in thousands of colors - a confident woman!!! I wish everyone such successes!!! Because mental hygiene as well as mental health itself is important if not the most important :) And if any crisis appeared, I would go only and exclusively to Ms. Anna, although she taught me a lot about how to deal with problems :)", "redacted": 3}

On the surveyed areas with animal paths, as many as 308 common ticks were counted, while on control areas there were over seven times fewer - only 43 specimens! Meanwhile, 435 meadow ticks (Dermacentor) were caught on animal paths, and on control areas - only 135 (over three times fewer). Such a large accumulation of ticks near forest tracks is related to the presence of animals that are their hosts. Roe deer, deer, or wild boars - moving through the forest - do not do so chaotically but use paths. And that's where the most ticks end up, which - after drinking blood - fall off the animals' skin to: as in the case of nymphs - transform into adult form; or lay eggs, as adult females do.
