As the director of the facility, Dr. Jan Kowalski, informed, the hospital has no debts. However, both the university and the hospital management are already considering the future financing of the facility. It is known that after the completion of the investment, the current maintenance costs will increase significantly. The hospital hopes that the NFZ will take this into account in future contracts, because for now, the Fund is the main source of funding for the hospital's operations. \"For example, the new hospital building will need an amount of electricity per year equal to the needs of a district town of about 20,000 people,\" emphasizes director Jan Kowalski. \"On the other hand, heating the helipad will cost about 150 PLN per hour,\" added vice-rector Jan Kowalski.", "redacted": 3}

It seemed to me that this psychological method would help me - and so it did. A great method, which was conducted with incredible skill (a word more fitting than \"skillfully\" probably doesn't exist) and strengthened me mentally a lot. I am now a much more distanced person from the world - at the same time full of not only a sense of humor but also engagement in matters and actions that are important to me. This therapy is certainly intended for people who are capable of a lot but unaware of their skills, withdrawn due to depression. ACT teaches how to look at yourself, and the psychologist helps in shaping a \"strong backbone\". I will definitely recommend it.", "redacted": 1}

Primarily to the urbanization of life, change in lifestyle, sedentary lifestyle, lack of physical activity, and poor nutrition.

{"opinion_id": "op_002666", "lang": "en", "text": "When Anna Kowalska considers how to destroy cancer - she always checks if her methods of fighting won't destroy our healthy organs. She was the first in the world to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors impair heart function. The work she conducted together with Dr. Jan Kowalski from the University of Verona was to help doctors better select patients for treatment with proteasome inhibitors to reduce the risk of unexpected side effects. It turned out that although the drugs are toxic, their effects disappear some time after discontinuation. So patients don't have to fear that they will cure cancer only to - healthy - die of heart disease. The researcher has also been looking for ways to kill cancer with light for many years. First, she \"sensitizes\" cancer cells to light, and then applies a lethal combination of oxygen and laser light. However, cancer is a tough opponent. When it turned out that some cancers can survive such murderous therapy, the researcher inhibited certain enzymes that helped them in this. Publications on this topic were accepted by renowned journals promoting achievements in world biochemistry and experimental oncology.", "redacted": 2}

I never had an ultrasound ordered so it's unknown if there was any effect of giving Clo. The doctor first stated that I certainly have anovulatory cycles (which later turned out to be untrue), then that I probably suffer from PCOS but laparoscopy and ultrasound ruled that out. After laparoscopy, I was told that I would be pregnant within half a year (5 months have passed and I am not) even though he knew that the male factor was largely a problem for us. He never proposed cycle monitoring. Now, when we finally changed doctors and I did all the necessary tests, I know that with me everything is rather OK - it's a pity that only the next doctor ordered me these tests because maybe we could have avoided laparoscopy and approached insemination right away... :(", "redacted": 1}

Dr. Jan Kowalski did not allow the patient, swaying in the chair with pain, to say what I came with, claiming that he would tell me himself, and I would only confirm. After that, he gave me a looong lecture on hygiene, that I sleep poorly, and during the ultrasound exam, he found some adhesion of the uterus to the ovary, because of which I would not be able to get pregnant. When I showed him the ultrasound result from a few months ago, where everything is OK, he looked at it and gave it back to me saying that \"he doesn't know about that\". Of course, he gave me a stack of prescriptions, including for Biostreptase - suppositories that were supposed to dissolve these adhesions. He recommended 5 monthly treatments, with one costing over 150 PLN. My gynecologist, whom I saw just a month earlier, said that everything is fine with me. Scared by this news about adhesions, I consulted a third gynecologist... and he stated that the structure of my reproductive organs is fully correct and that no adhesions are visible. I cannot imagine what kind of person you have to be to push a story to a correctly built woman that she won't be able to have children, unless she takes miracle suppositories, which of course are best bought on the spot, at the clinic.

If a patient who had a heart attack had stem cells in a cell bank, they could receive a patch produced by scientists after a few days. \"Stem cells will help reduce the scar.

However, later it turned out that he downplayed a certain ailment of mine that two other doctors became interested in. The matter fortunately did not turn out to be serious, but Dr. Jan Kowalski didn't even deal with it and didn't refer me for further tests. I regret to state that he is not particularly caring and inquisitive, which in the case of a doctor is a flaw. It is also true that he does not keep patient records and often treats \"superficially\" even those patients he has known for years and on whom he has earned a lot.
