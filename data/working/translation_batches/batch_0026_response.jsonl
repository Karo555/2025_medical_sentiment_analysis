Then, as part of a Fulbright Program scholarship, he spent a year at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris. In 1970, he obtained a doctorate in biophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As part of his postdoctoral studies, he conducted genetic research for three years at the University of Edinburgh (Scotland). He himself assessed that it was a wonderful time, both from a personal and professional point of view. In 1974, he joined the staff of Brandeis University in Waltham (Massachusetts), with which he has been associated to this day. At this university, Rosbash began conducting genetic research on the mechanisms of the biological clock, i.e., circadian rhythms, in living organisms. In 1984, together with the second Nobel laureate of that year – his collaborator and friend Jeff Hall – they cloned the gene controlling the biological clock of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They named it period (abbreviated as per). Daily changes in the level of the protein encoded by this gene regulate the rhythm of activity and sleep of the flies over a period of about 24 hours.", "redacted": 0}

Since the operation was performed by Dr. Jan Kowalski! dad during check-up visits never received a referral for a CT scan or MRI, I will only add that dad has a malignant tumor. At the moment, thanks to the \"wonderful\" treatment of Dr. Jan Kowalski, dad has a recurrence of the tumor (which he felt himself) plus distant metastases. Dr. Jan Kowalski was of course very surprised how it could be metastases since his check-up visits lasted as long as 2 minutes!!!! With a clear conscience, I do NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!! stay as far away as possible from such specialists!!", "redacted": 3}

And that is very important in such a delicate field. She is also professional. I go to her private office. There is a pleasant atmosphere there. I am writing about this because I think it is also important to feel good in the office itself, especially since for many women a visit to the gynecologist is a big stress. I was also nervous, but thanks to Dr. Anna Kowalska, that feeling is now foreign to me. I have been a patient of Dr. Anna Kowalska for a long time and I don't even think about changing :)", "redacted": 2}
{"opinion_id": "op_000505", "lang": "en", "text": "For two years, neurologists at the University Clinical Hospital in Olsztyn have been conducting research on the use of stem cells in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A characteristic feature of this disease is that it progresses at a constant rate. The effect of ALS includes, among other things, a loss of muscle strength in the hands of sick people, making them less independent (e.g., they cannot lift a cup by themselves). The doctors from Olsztyn, who as part of scientific research administer stem cells to ALS patients, have so far lacked tools that would objectively indicate whether the muscle strength in their patients' hands remains at a constant level or weakens (there is no biological marker that would indicate this - PAP). \"The patients' own feelings, or those of their relatives, in this regard were not reliable, often depending on the patient's mood on a given day,\" admitted neurolog Tomasz Siwek in an interview with PAP, who is a member of the team researching the impact of stem cells on slowing down ALS.

Her treatment methods are long-term, she does not prescribe \"aggressively\" acting drugs. I have vaginal inflammation, which I have been treating with Ms. Agrawal for quite a long time and I finally decided to go to another gynecologist. It is possible that I am not consistent enough with Ms. Agrawal's natural methods and I cannot fully recover. It is like with other diseases, they can be overcome by boosting the immunity of the whole body but sometimes the disease is so strong that there is no other treatment method besides \"aggressive\" therapy (e.g., antibiotics). I recommend Ms. Agrawal to all women who want to be more aware of their bodies, but it is also worth using the help of a more \"traditional\" gynecologist (I do that).", "redacted": 1}

Right after the operation, he wanted to discharge me home, during the round he told me to pack up and only then the nurse asked me if I had tingling in my fingers or on my face, I said that I did (I thought it was normal after surgery) only then did he get scared and immediately ordered tests, attention - I stayed in the hospital for another week (I took drugs orally and in the form of a drip - 3 times a day!!!), because it turned out that I had hypocalcemia!!! That's first, second, after the operation I had a squeaky (whining) voice and I got tired quickly after saying a few sentences, and he says, well what a beautiful voice, what's wrong with you, but 1.5 months passed after the operation and I still had it, so I went to a phoniatrist (Dr. Wakarow - I highly recommend) and she said, why did I only come now (I had a unilateral paralysis of something in the throat), she prescribed me injections and iontophoresis (for 1.5 months), and why? because his excellency Count Doctor told me not to read the Internet and what do I want, since I'm just after surgery. All in all, I do not recommend this surgeon!!! Besides, he is impolite, he knows best and that's it.

{"opinion_id": "op_000516", "lang": "en", "text": "As explained by Dr. Pieczykolan, clinical practice shows that molecules effective against cancer cells also cause damage to the patient's healthy tissues and organs, often leading to debilitating complications. The solution to the problem of cancer diseases, as well as most civilization diseases, would be therapy meeting the criteria of Paul Ehrlich's idea, the so-called \"magic bullet,\" which would ideally hit the target - transformed, damaged cells. Such an ideal molecule, using all the means of transport available to the organism, such as blood, lymph, would reach only the cancer-transformed cells and destroy them. Such an assumption underlies the ONCO-3 CLA project, as well as many targeted therapies developed worldwide. The Polish therapy consists of three levels of activation. In the first stage, a natural mechanism in the cancer process is utilized - perforation, i.e., the loosening, destruction of connections between blood vessel cells. Through ruptures in the vessel epithelium, drugs can penetrate from the blood into the tumor. Furthermore, the molecule is constructed in such a way that it recognizes certain receptors on the surface of cancer cells and binds only to those cells.", "redacted": 0}
