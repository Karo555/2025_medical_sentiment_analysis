The entire 90 minutes of the doctor's intensive work with the patient was worth every penny spent. Thank you very much.", "lang": "en"}

The visit card was accurately and clearly described - explanation of how to proceed, what tests to do next, issued referrals and prescription.

Several days have passed since the consultation and these positive effects still persist. In summary, a very good neurologist, I am very grateful, I warmly recommend.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_003734", "text": "I don't understand why someone decides to become a pediatric neurologist when they don't like children and treat parents with clear disrespect. My experience with the doctor was unfortunately unpleasant. This doctor doesn't explain diagnoses, avoids answering questions, and makes inappropriate comments. For example, she mentioned something about dying unvaccinated children, even though my daughter is vaccinated according to the schedule. Additionally, she unnecessarily commented on my lack of knowledge as a first-time parent, which was inappropriate.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_003738", "text": "The worst visit of my life. Total lack of empathy. An incorrect diagnosis that she verbally communicated to us was not confirmed during hospital examinations.

{"opinion_id": "op_003739", "text": "This is my first review on this portal. Today was the worst visit of my life. I have never met such a rude, such an angry doctor who lacked minimal normal communication skills. We are refugees from Ukraine and maybe that's why this woman was so unpleasant to us, or maybe she is just a very unpleasant person in general. Either way, I cried on the way home because the entire meeting was pure horror and stress. During the visit, me and my husband, the biological father of the child, felt like spoiled students. The doctor either mocked us, made sharp, ironic remarks, or grabbed her head and lamented: \"God, how you ruined this child, how bad everything is\". And all this, mind you, with the child present! Then she incorrectly commented on the fact that the child doesn't live with the mother, and we had to explain why anyway. Although this is absolutely none of her business. There are no words to describe the whole situation, but we will be under terrible stress for a very long time.", "lang": "en"}
