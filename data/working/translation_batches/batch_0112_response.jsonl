Positive feelings, a very thorough doctor, she is not ashamed to consult a book when it comes to matching the right medicine to my blood or urine results. I still have doubts whether she is too young to manage my pregnancy (this is my first baby)... I hesitate whether to change to a more experienced doctor but only due to an internal feeling that with such little experience she might overlook something... nonetheless I recommend! and certainly to young girls who are afraid of visits to the gynecologist :) with her it's pure pleasure :)", "redacted": 0}

In the case of sepsis, during the development of invasive meningococcal disease in a child, a rash appears in the form of petechiae on the skin. Currently, one can protect themselves against the most important bacteria causing sepsis with vaccinations. The Polish mandatory vaccination schedule includes vaccinations against H. influenzae type B and against pneumococci. Vaccinations against meningococci are in the recommended schedule and parents must finance them themselves. For the youngest children, the most important is vaccination against meningococci type B, which are responsible for IChM in over 80% of children up to one year of age. In the group of teenagers, vaccinations against meningococci type C are primarily recommended. A vaccine against four serotypes of meningococci – C, A, Y and W 135 – can also be used.

This has also been patented and significantly brings closer the possibilities of obtaining oleacein in an industrial form, which will serve to produce the future drug. It is much easier to isolate oleacein from privet leaves than from olive oil, and the plant can grow even on poor soil and does not require maintenance procedures or irrigation. According to the scientist from WUM, oleacein in capsules could be as effective as olive oil, and its intake much more convenient (besides, several dozen milliliters of olive oil are high in calories and with daily consumption may promote obesity).", "redacted": 0}

{"opinion_id": "op_002233", "lang": "en", "text": "Hello warmly! I had two nose plastic surgeries performed by Dr. Witwiski, the first was a correction of the cartilaginous part in 2012, and a full correction in 2016. The result unfortunately is very unsatisfactory both after the first and the second surgery. After the first procedure the nose was indeed a bit shorter, but after the wounds healed it took on a strange shape, thickenings appeared, the tip of the nose drooped, the nose simply disfigured the face. After consultation with Dr. Jan Kowalski I decided to go for a second surgery, this time a full correction. Currently the nose has a somewhat better shape but nonetheless it is far from a nice appearance. The bone is unevenly filed on one side (I pointed this out to Dr. Jan Kowalski during a control visit - I heard that it's probably still a wound after the procedure and should heal). The unevenness remains to this day. To sum up, yes the nose looks somewhat better than before the surgeries, but nonetheless after two procedures I expected a definitely! better result. Personally, I cannot recommend!", "redacted": 2}

The study was conducted on the initiative of UJ medical students, and it was financed by a grant \"Generation of the Future\" from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. \"We compared risk indicators for cardiovascular diseases in residents of two Polish cities – Krakow and Lublin, which are similar to each other in terms of demographics and climatic conditions, but differ significantly in terms of air pollution. This applies especially to pollution with particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) and 10 micrometers (PM10)\" - explained Prof. Guzik to PAP. He reminded that Krakow is among the leaders of the most polluted European cities, while Lublin is located in the center of one of the least polluted areas in Poland. From data that scientists obtained from air quality monitoring stations, it appears that over the last 10 years the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 was in Krakow about twice as high as in Lublin.", "redacted": 2}

We will develop both final drugs and their precursors used to prepare radiopharmaceuticals\" - explains Prof. Mikołajczak. The process of producing radiopharmaceuticals - informs NCBJ - is multi-stage. Protons, deuterons or alpha particles accelerated in the cyclotron will hit targets with a specially selected composition. In them, as a result of nuclear transformations caused by the bombarding particles, radioactive isotopes of elements will be created. Radioisotopes are produced in a similar way in the stream of neutrons coming from a nuclear reactor. The list of nuclides interesting from a medical point of view includes several dozen elements – from the lightest carbon C-11, to the heaviest actinium Ac-225. Radionuclides created in the irradiated targets must first be separated from them, and then thoroughly purified – both chemical and physical methods are used for this purpose.", "redacted": 1}
