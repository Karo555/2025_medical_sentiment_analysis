His knowledge + intensive exercise sets, commitment, and willingness work 'miracles'! He opened my eyes that this, that, and that doesn't work and doesn't function normally, which is why such and such things happen. Now my work and training have finally become pure pleasure and not a struggle with myself! :) I RECOMMEND! To finish, I will add that after a few visits I brought my mother, who for 9 months had been struggling with sharp shoulder pain, visiting various specialists, doctors during this period, paying a fortune. Moreover, no one helped her even a bit during this time, and every day she took 2-3 painkillers for the pain. After the visit to Krzysiek, it turned out that she had torn tendons. And after his first, 3-hour, very painful visit and massages, she made it to the next visit only with bruises, but already WITHOUT painkillers! :) Krzysiek is truly a SPECIALIST WORTH RECOMMENDING.
