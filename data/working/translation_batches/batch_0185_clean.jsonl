{"opinion_id": "op_003686", "text": "I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Anna. The doctor is very nice, friendly, approaches people with empathy. A doctor by vocation, an exceptional person. Committed to what she does. She conducted a very detailed interview and neurological examination. I had been to several other neurologists before visiting the doctor, and none of them examined me and questioned me about various details as thoroughly as the doctor. From each I only heard \"that's just how you are,\" \"you just have it that way.\" However, the doctor looked more deeply into my case. She devoted a lot of time to me, sufficiently enough. She ordered a series of tests to be done, indicated where best to perform them, gave advice and guidance on how to live and cope with my ailments. After the visit with the doctor, my husband and I were shocked that such doctors even exist, we had never met such an exceptional and competent doctor before.", "lang": "en"}
