It is a true gift to conduct a conversation and examination in such a way as not to evoke negative emotions in patients. A plus is also the convenient location and ease of booking an appointment. However, I regret to say that the diagnosis made by Dr. Anna Kowalska turned out to be incorrect in my case. After the first ultrasound, the doctor informed me about a cyst on the ovary with a solid consistency. During subsequent visits, she confirmed the initial diagnosis, first recommending observation, then treatment with contraceptive pills. Since the \"cyst\" did not shrink, I was referred to a hospital for surgical removal of this lesion. Upon admission, it turned out that the ovarian cyst was actually a submucosal uterine fibroid, which does not require surgery but only observation. The doctors at the hospital stated that in this case, distinguishing between these two types of lesions was not easy, but that my attending physician should have at least had doubts and referred me to an office with better ultrasound equipment. This whole situation was extremely stressful for me, and I very much regret that I did not go to another doctor earlier to consult the diagnosis. Nevertheless, I remain full of respect for the atmosphere in Dr. Anna Kowalska's office and appreciate her work - but I will not return to the office.", "redacted": 2}

Very thorough, no gynecologist has ever examined me so thoroughly before. She explains, answers questions, well-prepared, does not rush - both during the visit and regarding treatment - at the first visit, a large cyst on the ovary was observed, the doctor said to wait until the next period. During this time, while on vacation in the middle of the cycle, I bled heavily, I consulted another doctor who almost sent me to the operating table, alternatively a bag of pills. I refused, at a follow-up visit with Dr. Jan Kowalski, the examination showed that the cyst had been absorbed. A very good doctor!", "redacted": 1}

{"opinion_id": "op_002587", "lang": "en", "text": "I also regret to say that I was very disappointed with this doctor. In December, I started having terrible abdominal pains that lasted for days. Encouraged by friends' opinions, I decided to have a gastroscopy with Dr. Jan Kowalski. At first, the doctor made a positive impression on me - nice, eloquent, etc. He detected problems with my gallbladder, erosions, and single colonies of Candida. He ordered an ultrasound, stool tests for yeast and lamblia, etc. It seemed to me that finally someone would take care of me professionally. The ultrasound only detected trace sand in the gallbladder, the stool test did not show parasites or fungi. After a month of waiting (in unceasing abdominal pain) for another consultation, I happily showed up at Dr. Jan Kowalski's office with the test results. I thought finally the beginning of treatment, it will only get better. The doctor looked at the results and stated that he did not expect such a \"bad\" ultrasound result of the gallbladder, that \"deposits\" are forming there and the gallbladder walls are \"thickened\" which was not in the description of the doctor who performed the ultrasound. He stated that we would have to see each other again in 3 months, repeat the gastroscopy and ultrasound, and if the gallbladder does not heal somewhat, then surgery might be possible? My face, terrified by this news, and verbal doubts, he commented with words to \"pull myself together and take the medication\" THEN he prescribed me antibiotics for Candida parasites which no tests detected and a bunch of other protective medications, etc. At the pharmacy, I left 650 zł for a 3-month treatment, I walked out with a big bag and the lady at the pharmacy asked if I wanted an invoice for a disabled group? hehe (I'm 26 years old) :) Daily I was supposed to take 15 different tablets + 6 painkillers in case of ailments. I don't need to add that on the 3rd day of taking the medications, I ended up in the Emergency Department at ul. Kopernika. I had terrible abdominal pain, dizziness, diarrhea, and vomiting, I couldn't eat anything at all. I was terrified and sure that it was not side effects but that my \"gallbladder inflammation had taken on the character of acute inflammation\". Really, the treatment from Dr. Jan Kowalski is not worth these nerves. Maybe he helps people with minor problems like curing Helicobacter, erosions, reflux... but he approached my condition very unprofessionally, did not recognize it at all, insinuating chronic gallbladder inflammation, yeast, and parasites. To sum up, I DO NOT RECOMMEND AGAIN!!!!! Please think twice before you decide to visit this doctor. Regards, Jan", "redacted": 2}

I don't want to ruin his reputation, but I won't change my mind and still rate him poorly after many experiences of mine and very close people with his participation as a doctor!!!!
