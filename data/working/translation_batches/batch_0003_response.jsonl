After all, I didn't care about being patted on the head, only about a quick return to health, which also happened and for that I am grateful to Dr. Jan Kowalski. The laryngology department of the Military Clinic is a very good department and I recommend it to everyone (besides FESS, I also had my tonsils removed there), the \"human face\" of the health service is provided there by nursing care, which is invaluable, the nurses are patient, smiling, always willing to help, even when a person is boring, I never heard a bad word, I always got help, and that the doctors are focused on their work and the boss doesn't have time for everything... well, life...", "redacted": 1}

The Lady Doctor professionally explained to me all the pros and cons of various therapies and medications, selected the most appropriate way to fight the disease for my lifestyle, precisely wrote everything down for me on a piece of paper and even prescribed additional \"emergency\" medications. The visit took place at the Dermed clinic, where I had previously been to a few \"aces\" and was effectively discouraged from treatment (rushed, superficial visits, lack of any information about the given therapy and history about previous medications I had used, in a word - total brush-off), so I recommend this particular Lady among the many who work there, she is a real treasure!", "redacted": 0}

The most interesting question is where these new genes come from and where this diversity comes from. This is part of the project I will be implementing. The hypothesis is that they come from closely related bacteria, good bacteria that do not harm us. This hypothesis raises many questions. Because it turns out that it is impossible to separate the good from the bad bacteria, there is no black and white in nature, in microbiology and medicine. So how to treat and combat bacteria that cause diseases if they can exchange genes with good bacteria? What really is a bacterial species, since they often exchange genes and new species arise? These are questions at the intersection of evolutionary biology and medicine to which we do not yet know the answers. Interviewed by Anna Kowalska", "redacted": 2}

I went to the doctor to have a mid-pregnancy ultrasound done during pregnancy - it is done before the 6th month of pregnancy to check if the fetus is developing properly, in case of detection of serious genetic diseases there is still a legal possibility of abortion. So the examination is important and it's not about psychological support but professional checking of what's happening in the mother's belly. Dr. Jan Kowalski as I see treated me standardly because the entire visit lasted less than five minutes total, after which I received three lines of text - nothing about organ development, just some generalities that I am pregnant - the gestational sac is visible, he significantly underestimated the gestational age, no specifics at all which completely misses the point of the visit! Additionally, the doctor informed me about the baby's gender - 100% girl which surprised me because previously I had been told several times it was a boy, so I asked several times if it was definitely a girl then the doctor started talking to me about gender, that it's a girl but it might change into a boy etc and when I tried to get direct information about what he sees there he kept talking about how it might be gender because it's trendy now... Since I received very limited information I went to a trusted gynecologist privately, there the visit lasted about 40 minutes and I received a detailed description of each organ, an approximate due date and very detailed photos of the baby including his penis... Say what you want but an NHS doctor cannot behave like this. After reading the comments and after personally getting to know the doctor I strongly advise against, at least for pregnant women.", "redacted": 1}

Maybe someone will say that's relatively short, but varicose veins cannot be gotten rid of forever.

A good specialist consults with other doctors if he is not sure about the diagnosis to help the patient.

A CT scan was obviously done but the doctor said it was just hormonal nodules? Of course without consultation because he is a specialist in everything after all.

He spoke about the latest, already fifth generation of the so-called gamma knife (Gamma Knife), which allows operating brain tumors without the need to open the skull or make incisions in its bones. Instead of a scalpel, cobalt radiation (gamma) divided into 192 beams is used. Each of them is safe for brain tissue, only their accumulation, focused in one place, causes the destruction of pathological tissues.", "redacted": 2}

There are epilepsies that do not require treatment at all because the seizures are extremely rare - they occur once or twice in a lifetime.

{"opinion_id": "op_000060", "lang": "en", "text": "Horror. I was once in a private practice to confirm a diagnosis made by someone else. The Gentleman Doctor receives patients with the help of several assistants, there's a lot of buzz around the visit, and everyone - as I saw - the patient is sent to adjacent little rooms for sets of all possible tests. I immediately got referrals for several that didn't seem to have anything to do with my condition. Since financially I was prepared rather for a visit, I asked what the cost of the tests would be. It was of course huge. I noted that I only have such and such amount of money with me, to which the Gentleman Doctor grimaced and for the tests that didn't fit in that amount he issued a referral. For example he noted that a throat swab must absolutely be done on an empty stomach (just a moment earlier I was supposed to have this test done on site, and so - if I had paid - there would be no talk of it being on an empty stomach). I saw that other patients, without exception, are also directed to all these tests and perform them with madness in their eyes. In the end I was also referred for a dozen or so \"nose physiotherapy\" procedures and by the assistants I was pushily, in my feeling, persuaded to schedule a whole series. I left with enormous distaste and zeroed out of money. Initially with a feeling that maybe the doctor was right and you need to be treated comprehensively, but after cooling down I tapped myself on the head and the next day I called back resigning from the shady procedures. And luckily, because it turned out later that surgical intervention was needed, and if I had stayed there I might still be expensively inhaling there. Generally - an efficient and well-organized money-extracting machine. In my opinion, it deserves intervention by the Medical Chamber.", "redacted": 0}
