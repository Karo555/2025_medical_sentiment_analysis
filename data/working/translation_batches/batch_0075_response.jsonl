Over all these years I visited very many doctors - otolaryngologists. None of them were able to help me in any way, and the methods they proposed boiled down to punctures and invasive sinus cleaning through a hole cut in the jaw... I never decided to do it. All these years I couldn't breathe freely, had very strong headaches, constant sinusitis, several times a year I had tonsillitis... The draining secretion didn't let me sleep... In May, my mom's friend recommended Mr. Jan Kowalski to me as a doctor who would definitely help me. I found the number online and made an appointment. The doctor immediately after examining me and looking at the CT scans proposed a surgical procedure involving unblocking the sinus opening, reducing the turbinates, and nasal septum plasty. After the procedure, the sinuses were supposed to self-clean. For the first time I encountered such a quickly made, professional diagnosis. The procedure was performed a month later at the hospital in Dęblin. Everything happened completely painlessly under anesthesia. I spent about 10 hours in the hospital. After the nasal dressings were removed the next day, I found out how deeply one can breathe. I am currently 2 months post-op and I don't know how I could live until now with such a blocked nose. The applied treatment was 100% effective. Mr. Jan Kowalski is a doctor worth recommending. He is a reliable, competent, polite, and communicative person. I recommend him to everyone with a clear conscience. All my problems have subsided. The difference I felt after the dressing was removed a day after the surgery put me in shock. I warmly greet the Doctor!!", "redacted": 1}

It's a pity he said that after ordering me to do a whole bunch of tests which gave nothing. In my opinion, he is a doctor who can recognize the simplest allergies, prescribe the simplest drugs like \"alertec\", \"zyrtec\" and that's it. And where is the treatment of causes, after all treatment isn't about masking symptoms???

{"opinion_id": "op_001491", "lang": "en", "text": "According to World Health Organization data, breast cancer is still the most common cause of death due to cancer among women. Although detectability of breast cancer at an early stage of development is increasing, in the case of one third of patients a decision is made to perform a mastectomy. According to medical society guidelines, every woman after mastectomy should have access to breast reconstruction. However, international studies indicate that despite informing patients and equalizing access chances to reconstruction, still few women decide on the procedure - says Dr. Anna Kowalska from the Katowice branch of SWPS. A team of psychologists coordinated by Dr. Anna Kowalska showed that the decision about breast reconstruction is conditioned by the woman's well-being, meaning high self-esteem and sense of self-efficacy - it was informed in a SWPS communique. Reconstruction is therefore not an antidote to poor functioning after mastectomy, but an expression of acceptance of the disease and an investment of possessed resources to achieve full own potential.", "redacted": 1}

{"opinion_id": "op_001493", "lang": "en", "text": "My objective assessment: constant delays in the office, best to come half an hour late because you almost never get in on time, also you can't count on the doctor showing up at the agreed 10 AM, most likely it will be 11:30. The professionalism and experience of the doctor unfortunately are dominated by superficiality and laziness or (hopefully) lack of time because contact with the patient is usually about 5 minutes. Usually doesn't listen to patient's remarks, doesn't inform about treatment progress - she knows her stuff and knows what she's doing but for those 160 PLN she could at least put in a bit of effort. One gets the impression that she doesn't \"get into\" this treatment because what she \"doesn't earn\" with the apparatus she makes up with recontouring. And so remain filed-down, hypersensitive teeth, about two a bit crooked, bite so-so... And on top of that a price list change during the contract!!! Unfortunately the effect is not worth the invested money. Office not for demanding patients! To top it off requests for positive comments along with providing website addresses, for me - unacceptable.

{"opinion_id": "op_001495", "lang": "en", "text": "This disorder arises in the stem cells of the bone marrow, meaning those from which all other cells can arise, in this case those produced in the bone marrow. This mutation stimulates the bone marrow to produce an excessive number of immature white blood cells (granulocytes, immune cells), which are more viable and displace those that are normal. They damage the bone marrow in the process and don't properly protect against infections. When they penetrate into the bloodstream, they also cause damage to internal organs, e.g. spleen and kidneys. 15 years ago the first drug inhibiting the action of the BCR-ABL mutation, which is key for the development of myeloid leukemia, was developed. Since then several other similarly acting drugs have been introduced.

The basic skill expected from a medical university graduate is to diagnose cancer. A young doctor must know what symptoms may suggest cancer in a patient and skillfully conduct diagnostics. However, specialized treatment is reserved for oncologists, oncological surgeons, radiotherapists, oncological gynecologists etc. The approach differs in the case of each cancer. The \"Innovations in Oncology\" conference is to convey already specialized knowledge about colon, ovarian and thyroid cancer. Doctors will learn how patients can be treated surgically, what are the advances in chemotherapy and what to require from pathomorphologists who create the histopathological report.
