Besides that, rich knowledge and a wide range of advice, suggestions, which never made me feel inferior or pigeonholed. I am still impressed by the empathy and understanding of Pani Anna's situation.

(where I found out that I am a neglectful mother and neglected a 6-week-old baby) Then we ended up with Dr. Jan Kowalski and it was a REVELATION. If it weren't for Him, I would have put my child in a splint, a Frejka pillow or something similar according to the first lady doctor's recommendations. And Dr. Jan Kowalski explained everything, told me and gave recommendations, a visit to a neurologist, rehabilitation and exercises at home + orthopedic shoes. The child is now so active we can't keep up. We go for check-ups systematically and there is improvement. The approach to the child is also okay. I RECOMMEND", "redacted": 3}

The treatment always proceeded the same and always on the same pills. But the relapse of the disease always appeared after some time. So I thought I would invest what for me is a very large amount of money (180 zł per visit) and maybe Dr. Jan Kowalski would come up with some new, more effective therapy. Unfortunately, it turned out that nothing else could be done in this matter and the treatment is again based on the same medicines, etc. So theoretically, I spent 180 zł for what I had been hearing all along. Nevertheless, I give a good rating because he is certainly a professional. What holds me back from a very good rating is only that when you pay such money, 5-10 minutes in the office is a bit short.", "redacted": 1}

Despite paying 140 złoty for the visit, it looked like a regular visit to a state doctor, where I felt bad about disturbing the lady doctor while she was drinking coffee. She completely didn't want to listen to my medical history because 'what happened before is not important - what matters is if it hurts now'. She couldn't provide information on where my illness might come from, and - worse - she couldn't say if it would pass. To several of my additional questions, she answered 'I don't know' or 'hard to say'. It's a pity that for a few minutes of dubious quality advice, I had to pay so much. It ended with me being prescribed ear drops that can be bought over the counter and Nurofen - the simplest painkiller. Overall - I do not recommend.", "redacted": 0}

According to him, for ethical reasons, the therapeutic value of biosimilar drugs cannot be compared in large clinical trials. The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector Pani Kowalska informed that the institution she leads conducts about 1000 inspections annually in various places (manufacturers, warehouses, distribution) at a cost of 5 million zł.

After a few days when I recovered, I decided to verify this. I went to two different ophthalmologists. Of course, I didn't say that I had already been to the lady doctor and that I had an opinion that the child has poor vision. Neither of the doctors found the defect I was informed about. Additionally, I was informed that administering atropine for 5 days to such a small child is not currently practiced.

According to the sociologist, it may also happen that a patient using such support groups, forums, or simply internet content, will treat it as a replacement for a doctor's visit. \"So it will not be and/or a visit, but instead of a visit, which may delay making a correct diagnosis and also lead to negative health consequences\" - she emphasized.", "redacted": 0}
