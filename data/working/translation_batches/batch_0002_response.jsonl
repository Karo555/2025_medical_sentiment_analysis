He assumed it was just an ultrasound visit because I mentioned a cyst over the phone, among other things, and he had other patients at that hour; to be heard, I would have to schedule another appointment. It's a shame he didn't tell me this during registration, that it was that type of visit.

Even before the visit, it was easy to notice not only the doctor's high personal culture but also his cheerful disposition. During the visit, he listens tactfully, skillfully chooses words, and is ready to provide exhaustive answers. Meanwhile, he takes detailed notes. He draws conclusions aloud to confront them with the patient's feelings and confirm. After determining the appropriate diagnosis, he clearly describes the chosen medication, its effects, and warns about possible side effects. In my case, an additional fast-acting medication was needed. The doctor also writes a helpful note with instructions for the patient at the end. Greetings.", "redacted": 1}

After the first visit, I can say he is a very nice person, calm, providing advice, explaining things he wasn't asked about but which may be helpful. I won't give a rating yet, as I haven't used his help with any problem so far; I simply asked for a prescription for medications I must take. Interestingly, it turned out he could prescribe much more than I was previously told, so it would last longer - I was very happy about that. I think the pharmacists at the pharmacy were also very happy they didn't have to guess what the doctor prescribed - he wrote the prescription on the computer and printed it. A small thing, but after visits to doctors in smaller towns, one starts to have a bit of faith that maybe we aren't so technologically behind; ) By the way, the entire Dolmed seems like a decent medical center. Apparently, online registration will be available soon. For now, I can recommend it if someone is looking for a nice and helpful internist.

I also had a visit and hoped he would help with my problems, but he is only and exclusively focused on performing surgery. So if someone hopes to pay 300 zł and hear something different from him than other doctors say, they will lose 300 zł. My acquaintance had surgery with him and is satisfied.

After the second visit, it turned out that 120 zł was due again, despite reminding that this visit was supposed to cost 40 zł. During the second visit, we were also instructed to go for another test, this time to CZD in Międzylesie, due to a detected problem with the right ear's abnormal reaction to higher frequencies; when asked for a referral, the doctor said it was unnecessary. Unfortunately, as it turned out, CZD won't accept a child without a referral, so we have to go to the doctor again for a referral, which will probably cost another 120 zł, but this doctor certainly won't earn that money.

Of course, at the first visit, he assured that you can always call and ask. I never abused it, and the one time I called with a very important question, he told me to repeat that he doesn't provide consultations over the phone.

Anna doesn't sugarcoat. She just tells the truth. She can also express a position completely opposite to ours and present the matter as it is generally perceived. That is, as other people would see it. Simply to cope in real life. Anna is always smiling. Honestly, I always couldn't wait for the next visit to throw out more problems and receive some optimistic support. Of course, if you don't want to solve problems yourself, no one will do it for you. You have to want it yourself and work on yourself, and Anna can explain all matters so they are no longer a problem. Anna is a really nice, genuine person. Highly recommend. Anna", "redacted": 2}
{"opinion_id": "op_000039", "lang": "en", "text": "\"Atrial fibrillation, which is the most common rhythm disorder in adults, occurs when the atria do not contract. The heart starts beating irregularly, a pulse deficit appears peripherally, meaning the pulse wave in the radial artery does not coincide in time with the heart's work,\" explains the scholar from WUM. He estimates that atrial fibrillation is found in 5-10% of older people, and in Poland, about 400,000 people suffer from this disease. Patients with fibrillation complain of heart palpitations, weakness, limited ability to perform physical exertion. They may experience fainting or angina pain. Atrial fibrillation is diagnosed in an ECG recording. In cases where it occurs rarely and lasts briefly, a long-term recording is needed, e.g., Holter ECG. Prof. Jan Kowalski emphasizes that it is important to find the cause of this condition, e.g., an undetected heart defect. For this purpose, additional tests assessing the condition of the heart and lungs are performed: blood pressure measurement, heart echo, chest X-ray, and blood analysis.", "redacted": 1}
