{"opinion_id": "op_004263", "text": "I highly recommend Dr. Jan! Two months ago, I started at 113 kg, and today I'm at 91. That speaks for itself. The doctor is very thorough and inquisitive during the interview. He explained in detail what processes occur when consuming specific meals. He gave precise guidelines on what I can eat and what to absolutely avoid. He managed my insulin resistance and celiac disease very well through diet. I feel much better following the doctor's recommendations and have finally started losing weight.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_004272", "text": "Generally, I was satisfied with the visits, but punctuality is lacking - I had to remind them every time to send the diet updates. Additionally, after the last visit in March (I paid for the visit the next day), I did not receive an updated diet. I wrote a message to Anna, but the only response I received was that our last contact was in January. I later sent a message stating that we had a visit in March and a photo of the transfer, but there was no response. It's a shame because I think she is a good dietitian, but due to the lack of punctuality, collaboration is very difficult.", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_004280", "text": "There is a multitude of information and self-proclaimed dietitians regarding nutrition diets, but it's easy to go astray. Here, we have the solution to our problem. Anna is properly educated, and her knowledge defends itself in what she does with passion. She helps the sick. She is not afraid of difficult cases. I am a living example where her help, specifically the meal plan, brought my blood count to an ideal state in 2 months, even though I was after chemotherapy. I am grateful even though I didn't believe. I recommend Anna's advice to everyone - they work wonders.", "lang": "en"}
