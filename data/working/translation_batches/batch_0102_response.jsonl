For several years I have also been taking medication regularly, which initially gave good results. Unfortunately, over time their effect weakened and the anxiety began to intensify again. Then I made the decision to start therapy. To my great surprise, therapy with Pani Urszula gave very, very good results! My condition stabilized so much that I was able to come off the medication, which I never believed would happen. So please believe me that sometimes it's better to go to therapy first rather than start stuffing yourself with pills. Of course I recommend Pani Ula, she is a warm and very competent therapist.", "redacted": 1}

{"opinion_id": "op_002025", "lang": "en", "text": "I went privately to the Convictor endocrinology clinic in Pruszków for an appointment with dr Łazęcki to have a neck/thyroid ultrasound because for some time I had a palpable and visible lump on it (a ball protruding from the neck). Most of the appointment was spent entering my personal data into the computer (it was my first visit) and taking my medical history (do I smoke, drink, family diseases, etc.). The ultrasound itself lasted maybe two minutes. The male doctor basically limited himself to examining, or rather recording/taking a picture of the aforementioned lump, then said it was a 3 cm thyroid tumor and that a biopsy would be needed to determine its nature. Unfortunately, the ultrasound performed by the male doctor was very quick, very superficial and so inaccurate that it did not detect a second quite large tumor (1 cm), nor two smaller nodules within the same thyroid lobe! I learned about their presence after another ultrasound, which this time was performed by the best thyroid ultrasound specialist in Warsaw. For the appointment with dr. Łazęcki I paid 200 zł (in Warsaw it's 140 zł), I didn't get the ultrasound report from him immediately, he was supposed to prepare it the next day, in reality the report was ready only after 4 days - I called every day and asked if it was ready, because no one was kind enough to inform me. The news about the tumor knocked me off my feet, I wouldn't wish such a long wait for results on anyone, especially since it was a private appointment. I am currently one year post thyroid surgery, after the biopsy papillary bifocal cancer was suspected in me, hence the information from the ultrasound about two tumors was important. I was lucky - postoperative histopathology showed a benign tumor. I do not recommend Dr. Łazęcki.", "redacted": 1}

He added that most patients come to the doctor only after a fracture has already occurred. Then treatment is still possible, it protects against further fractures, but it no longer gives such a good effect, because a bone fracture usually indicates that the bone tissue is already of poor quality. \"We know that timely started osteoporosis treatment is effective and protects against bone fractures, especially the most dangerous ones like femoral neck fracture. The experiences of countries such as Canada and New Zealand confirm this, where years ago they implemented programs for early detection and treatment of this disease. The effect is that for 3 years they have been registering a decrease in osteoporotic fractures. I am convinced that we can achieve similar effects in our country as well. Just more people need to be treated\" - emphasized dr Misiorowski.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_002029", "lang": "en", "text": "According to him, the work of a scientist in a company does not differ significantly from work in a research institution. It is even somewhat more difficult, because the company must meet the expectations of the management related to capital engagement, schedules imposed for example in connection with projects co-financed from public funds. These factors cause the work to proceed more dynamically. However, the research methodology and the way of arriving at results does not differ from what we can observe in most research institutes and universities. Researchers involved in research for a commercial company must take into account certain limitations regarding e.g. publications. As dr Pieczykolan explained, this problem is solved when international patent applications appear. When the information enters the public domain, the project partners can already popularize the results of their research. Doctorates are also created within this work.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_002030", "lang": "en", "text": "Meanwhile, phosphates in the body are a component of ATP - the main fuel of cells, a substance necessary for every cell to live. And the muscle particularly sensitive to ATP deficiency is the diaphragm. When there is no energy reserve in its cells to work, the diaphragm simply stops. That the diaphragm of an infant will run out of energy reserves may result from various factors. Dr Szczęsny explains that ATP may for example be used by the immune system in the process of fighting upper respiratory tract infections or harmful substances from cigarette smoke. Besides, the phosphate reserve in bones is much smaller in children with low birth weight. An incorrect sleep position from the point of view of current SIDS prevention guidelines (i.e. on the stomach) may force the diaphragm to work harder, which also translates into increased energy demand. So, as the biologist suspects, in a situation of detecting a threat of sudden infant death, the doctor could for example decide to supplement the phosphate deficiency in the body. For now, however, these are hypotheses that will need to be confirmed in research.", "redacted": 1}
