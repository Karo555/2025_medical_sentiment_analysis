{"opinion_id": "op_000002", "text": "Hello, Some time ago I had an implant surgery performed by doctor Jan Kowalski. The surgery proceeded without problems, but what I saw after the bandages were removed was the biggest nightmare I have ever seen. My breasts looked worse than before the surgery, the skin was cut, damaged, the implants were visible, the wounds healed very slowly. I was devastated. My grandmother, who is 85 years old, has nicer breasts than me. After the surgery, I learned from my husband that the procedure lasted over 3 hours, where it typically lasts about 2. I asked if there were complications - apparently not, that the procedure was like any other. This nightmare lasted 3 years and I gathered courage and went to the Mediclinique clinic on Mickiewicza Street, where doctor Jan Kowalski works. After initial consultations, we established that I could undergo surgery to correct what someone \"messed up\". The doctor discussed everything with me in detail, had time for me, and didn't watch the clock like doctor Jan Kowalski., he dispelled all my fears, a true doctor. The surgery lasted about an hour, and the implantation of the new implants itself took 20 minutes - that's how Dr. Jan Kowalski does it. The scar is tiny, almost invisible. I highly recommend this doctor to people who want to undergo any surgery. He does everything. And I encourage corrections from other doctors.", "lang": "en"}

Dr. Jan Kowalski listened to me carefully, reviewed all my previous medical documentation, calmed me down. He proposed comprehensive treatment (chemical peels, laser, mesotherapy). I had a calendar of procedures set up. Finally, someone took comprehensive care of me, didn't dismiss me, treated me humanely. The procedures turned out to be effective, my face looks much better now. I also have an established plan for long-term treatment, so that the facial skin will look even better. What was most important to me - Dr Jan Kowalski creates a sense of security, is an excellent specialist, really knows what he is doing. He treats the patient as a partner, talks about contraindications, risks and benefits of procedures.

The visible scar is small, which is a big surprise to me. Knowing it would look like this, I would have decided to undergo the procedure 10 years earlier, when the change was small.

{"opinion_id": "op_000013", "text": "As Ludwikowski assesses, 100 dB significantly hinders speech understanding, moving in the world of sounds, disturbs our perception. The pain threshold is 120 dB and more. An increase of 1 dB above a certain threshold means a doubling of loudness. Between 100 and 120 dB it is therefore 4-6 times louder. These are airport thresholds, which is why everyone working on airport aprons has hearing protectors. Teachers and students do not have them, and yet this is a large group of people exposed to stress caused by noise. \"Teachers and children are subjected to this noise periodically every 45 minutes. Hearing has no chance to return to normal efficiency after one lesson. If we have exposure to 100 dB noise for 10 minutes, it requires 100 minutes of rest in comfortable conditions. Comfort for the ear is between 40 and 50 dB, so after a 10-minute break, a child should have over two lesson hours of silence for their auditory system to return to full efficiency. We are therefore talking about something that is unrealistic,\" admits Ludwikowski.", "lang": "en"}

I was accompanied by the conviction that the doctor has broad and deep, and very practical knowledge, and moreover, he understands what a joy the new little one is for me and that he enjoys this state with me : ) It was like that every time - the examinations were carried out very efficiently, gently, and yet effectively, the interview was thorough but not overly inquisitive or unnecessarily prolonged.

For two reasons: 1. when making an appointment with this specialist, I myself was guided by opinions about Him, and 2. I am sincerely delighted with the course of the visits. Let me start by saying that I have been seeking help for 2 years because I suffer from overload back pain in the lower section, and recently I have been suffering from neck pain, headache and tingling in my right hand. I omit visits to specialist doctors because, in short, it's a tragedy (mainly painkillers and muscle relaxants). Others stated that \"it's just my charm\" or stress. Slightly resigned, I made an appointment with Jan Kowalski. And here a big surprise. Not only is he a young man, full of energy, but he listened to me carefully, read all the descriptions of my examinations, examined me himself, explained everything to me, discussed it, debunked some myths, presented a plan of action and recommended exercises. And most importantly, the problems with my \"top\" practically ended (ignoring that some doctors had already decided my fate - rather surgery, because nothing will help), and the bottom hasn't completely let go, but it's much better. Besides, Jan Kowalski himself said that the regeneration processes would still take some time. Once again, thank you very much for your help and support.

He can point out incorrect lines of thinking, he can also show when the patient is thinking completely correctly. My impressions are very positive, although it is difficult for me to put them into words. What I lack is a longer conversation, but as a patient with a long history, I am aware that a psychiatrist deals mainly with the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of a specific disease, ailment. Therefore, I also signed up for behavioral psychotherapy to control anxiety. Jan Kowalski well chosen the medicine for me, listens to the patient's remarks.

Because that means that there are still no medicines that do not cause dependence (perhaps it is more about the risk of the symptoms of the disease returning with a so-called rebound) and that are safe.
