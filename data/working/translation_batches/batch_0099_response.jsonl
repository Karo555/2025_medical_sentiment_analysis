She spends too little time on the patient - the child; I kept hearing that she has other patients and that she can't spend so long convincing the child to open her mouth (my daughter, after being held down - after drilling the tooth, didn't want to open her mouth). She told her that if she didn't open her mouth and let her finish, she would end up in the emergency room and it wouldn't be nice there because they would hold her down and do everything by force.", "redacted": 1}

Before the procedure to remove my varicose veins, he explained everything thoroughly, I could ask him anything without hesitation, not to mention that you can always call and he will certainly answer the phone. The care at the clinic, both during and after the procedure, was wonderful, of course from the nurses and the doctor. Of course, I am very happy that I decided to have the procedure at the clinic, because it saved me time related to convalescence and probably scars that I would have had if I had gone to the public health service. I recommend to ladies who have problems with varicose veins the AestheticMed clinic and Dr. Jan Kowalski. Gosia", "redacted": 2}

Under such conditions, we comfortably release excess heat to the outside, even without noticing it. The difference between our internal heat and the ambient temperature is sufficiently large. At 25-28 degrees, we feel weak. We get tired quickly because the body conserves energy and prevents physical exertion. It must put all its energy into what is most important for us - maintaining a constant body temperature. And what happens when we overheat?

The scientist emphasized that OCT device manufacturers are constantly improving the equipment. Newer generations of devices offer greater possibilities, allowing a more detailed look at the structures of the eye. At the same time, diagnostic capabilities are increasing year by year. Just a few years ago, OCT examination was only possible in the largest centers in Poland. Now the equipment has become widespread and many ophthalmology clinics have it. In the West, OCT examination has become a diagnostic standard. It is not widely used preventively - patients are referred for it with indications, including long-term diabetes at risk of diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, or suspicion of other retinal diseases.", "redacted": 0}

Some of them use wheelchairs exclusively in their daily lives, others cannot see or are missing a limb. Among them are also those whose disability is harder to notice. Disabled competitors compete in different groups. The least able ride only at a walk; more able - at a walk and trot; others - also canter and those whose degree of disability allows it - also present lateral movements on horses. How hippotherapy positively affects the well-being and health of people with disabilities is clearly demonstrated by the story of Jan Kowalski (a young man with hemiplegia), who has been participating in such activities for many years and additionally takes part in para-equestrian competitions. Over the last 12 years, he has changed beyond recognition. As Anna Kowalska recalls, at the beginning he moved incorrectly and had problems with writing, psychologically he separated himself from others.

Additionally, she prescribed me pills that were supposed to improve my results - too high sugar after the curve. The pills turned out to be misguided, and it's good that I didn't take them because my sugar is normal and I would only have harmed myself, I could even have died. Too low sugar could lead to loss of consciousness and some accident. Instead of treating the lack of menstruation and too high prolactin, the doctor focuses on sugar, which, as it turned out, had nothing to do with the lack of period. I do not recommend!
