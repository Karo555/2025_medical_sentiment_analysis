{"opinion_id": "op_001801", "text": "Hello. For the first time, I completely lost trust in a doctor, and I'm sorry it's precisely Professor Jan Kowalski. Both the methods and the treatment approach of Professor Jan Kowalski leave much to be desired. Perhaps being taciturn is a desirable trait, but it's unacceptable when it comes to conveying information about medications to a patient. The patient is not the doctor. Due to improper decisions made by Professor Jan Kowalski, I ended up in the nearby department at Kopernika, because discontinuing medications by Professor Jan Kowalski, which apparently shouldn't have been done, caused me to develop disorders, unfortunately irreversible. Doctors were only wondering how it was possible and why such a decision was made. I also developed an additional chronic illness to deal with, which I will struggle with for the rest of my life, constant injections and complications. I cried looking at my test results and wondered why. It would have been enough to just look at the medical records. After my hospital stay, while browsing websites, I broke down - you don't need to be a professor to know that a medical error occurred, which the patient, not the doctor, will struggle with for the rest of life.....", "lang": "en"}

The patient spent several weeks lying down, and after being discharged home, immediately went on disability because they couldn't work. \"Truth be told, in the initial stages of heart attack treatment, both the doctor and the patient were helpless - in the early 80s, the patient was laid down for a month, not allowed to move for 2 weeks.

{"opinion_id": "op_001806", "text": "Hello, I had been going to Dr. Jan Kowalski for 5 years, it was always great, but... in September this year I got pregnant, of course tremendous joy, baby planned, I was at the doctor's visit, but since it was early pregnancy it was even hard to see anything... October 9th unfortunately I miscarried, of course I have no complaints about the doctor regarding that. I called the doctor immediately to inform what was happening, the doctor said that nothing can be done anymore and that I should come for a visit sometime later. After a week I called again and persuaded for a visit (I wanted to be sure everything was okay, I'll add that the doctor didn't send me to the hospital to check if any cleaning after miscarriage would be needed). After a week at the visit, Dr. Jan Kowalski did a transvaginal ultrasound of course and stated that I have huge cysts in my ovaries :( then added that it looks like polycystic ovary syndrome and \"please wait three months and try again and we'll see\" didn't order any referrals for additional tests to exclude or confirm this hypothesis, my husband convinced me to visit another doctor... I went, ultrasound again and information - it's not polycystic ovary syndrome, additionally the \"new\" gynecologist advised to go to an endocrinologist and get tested in that regard. I've already had thyroid tests, it turned out I unfortunately have Hashimoto's disease, which causes early miscarriages, fetal demise and also developmental defects... if I had stayed with Dr. Jan Kowalski, it could have ended tragically for me :( I personally discourage using this doctor's services, as someone already wrote I think he's a doctor for healthy people, and when problems appear Dr. Jan Kowalski is not able to guide towards their solution :(", "lang": "en"}

{"opinion_id": "op_001809", "text": "A researcher from the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences reminded that the possibility of therapeutic use of cannabis leaves was discovered already in ancient times by inhabitants of Eastern countries: India, China, Mesopotamia or Egypt. According to written sources, Chinese already in the 3rd millennium BC used extracts from these plants as painkillers and antispasmodics (reducing muscle stiffness). In the sacred books of Hinduism - Vedas, cannabis is mentioned as a medicine against pain, insomnia and as a means for surgical anesthesia. Europeans - the professor reminded - came up with the medical application of this plant relatively late - at the end of the 18th century. Moreover, in times closer to us - at the beginning of the 20th century, marijuana was outlawed in the USA and Canada, similarly happened on our continent. Then, over time, in the West a campaign against marijuana grew, which caused a kind of social taboo around any its use, also for therapy purposes.", "lang": "en"}

Twice he arranged with me visits at times other than his working hours and didn't show up at all - because he forgot - as he explained...

The proposed treatment brings effect, however the current price raised (over the last half year already twice) currently to 180 z≈Ç is, I suspect, not only for me, prohibitive. Dr. Jan Kowalski writes that he has no influence on raised prices in the facility where he works, I however heard from a facility employee that they have no influence on the doctor raising visit prices. Considering medication prices and the ordered list of tests done privately, private treatment in this country is unmanageable for an average earning patient. I understand education, practice abroad, need to value oneself, but raising visit prices so high in today's reality seems to be somewhat against the desire to help and save people's health. Even if a person wanted to be treated, they simply can't afford it anymore. Regardless of who actually raised this price, I wish success in further work. Best regards.", "lang": "en"}

Earlier Dr. Anna Kowalska determined child's condition as \"very good\" with recommendation of applying massage at home. After yesterday's visit it turned out we have to apply Vojta, and child was no longer \"very good\". Unfortunately it resulted from little interest in the child itself, Dr. Anna Kowalska was upset about losing keys and even didn't really know that this was our next visit, didn't refer to previous arrangements, just immediately ordered to apply Vojta (which method she really likes, as she herself trains physiotherapists). I'm just not sure if in situation when child after 3-hour car journey, awakened and hungry, didn't perform one \"support\" correctly, qualifies for Vojta method??!! Besides it was supposed to be last control visit (of course paid privately), and it turned out we still need to come.
