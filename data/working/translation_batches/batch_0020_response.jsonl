He played cat and mouse with me all day, first promising to induce contractions and then backing out moments later (my water broke but there were no contractions). Finally, after several hours, I got my way and received an IV drip. The reason this man gave for refusing oxytocin was that my doctor would be on duty in 12 hours and she would take care of me. I should add that this was a Saturday night into Sunday, 6 years ago, so traffic at Ujastek wasn't as heavy then. The delivery was terrible, no one took care of me, the midwife, a buddy of the \"doctor,\" also ignored me. Jan Kowalski joked in a disgusting way throughout the delivery, complained that he was underpaid and still had to deliver other people's babies. In the end, probably as revenge, he stitched me up without anesthesia, mocking me and mimicking my moans! Truly a \"wonderful\" doctor he is! May there be more like him! And I will never forget how you treated me, doctor, and I will continue to spread the word wherever I can!!", "redacted": 1}

All the tests I had done during pregnancy were requested by me; the doctor doesn't say anything on his own (you have to ask about everything, which visibly irritates him), he didn't deem it appropriate to order tests required for admission to the maternity ward. He doesn't comment on ultrasound results at all (just hands over the printout). I didn't have the opportunity to see my baby on the ultrasound, and when I asked about the baby's gender, I was told that it shouldn't matter to me (I had to go to another doctor to find out the gender). Throughout the pregnancy, the doctor didn't perform a single gynecological exam or breast exam on me.", "redacted": 0}

The doctor removed my son's adenoids; previously, the child had been treated by two other doctors without success. Here, the doctor knew how to handle us (especially the child) and how to remedy the situation; she is a very kind person and seems always happy with life. My friend, whose child is also scheduled for surgery, has already taken advantage of her professional advice. Children are not stressed around the doctor, so parents approach things differently; on the day of the procedure, hearing Ms. Anna's voice always calmed me down 90 percent. I highly recommend her with all my heart.", "redacted": 2}

The exercises Mr. Jan gave me helped a lot, even though I thought nothing could help my spinal issues anymore. Although I'm from Oświęcim, despite the distance, I decide to visit because it's really worth coming and benefiting from the help of one of the best physiotherapists in Poland. Mr. Jan responds to my emails and clarifies my doubts. Thanks to Mr. Jan, I believed that nothing is impossible; I am very grateful that he helped me regain my health.

{"opinion_id": "op_000387", "lang": "en", "text": "In the case of thyroid cancer, the risk of developing the disease is increased by a mutation in the microRNA-146a gene. In Poland, thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 2.5 thousand people annually, more often in women. In one out of 10 patients, the disease progresses very aggressively, quickly leading to metastases and death. These individuals should be treated very intensively from the start, undergo radical therapy, and be monitored. Prof. Jan Kowalski's team discovered a method that allows for more effective diagnosis of patients most at risk of an acute course of this disease. The research results were published in the journal \"Clinical Cancer Research.\" The test for the presence of the mutation can be done at Warsaw Genomics, a spin-off company of the University of Warsaw. The test requires 9 ml of peripheral blood (one tube). The cost is 300 PLN. \"We can also test all known genes responsible for the risk of developing any hereditary cancer. Such tests are available on the American and European markets. In Poland, several centers perform them, including Warsaw Genomics. Tests in Poland are even 10 times cheaper,\" says the scientist.", "redacted": 1}

After a few days and a change in treatment, the condition subsided. In summary, Ms. Anna did not demonstrate knowledge and experience. I wasted time and money. I do not recommend.", "redacted": 1}

Data from the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw show that in the first half of 2013, over 32 thousand infections were registered—almost ten times more than in the same period of 2012. \"This disease should no longer occur in any European Union country,\" emphasizes the specialist. In Poland, however, it is not related to vaccine refusal but to an incomplete vaccination program. Since 1988, only girls at 13 years of age were vaccinated against rubella; boys were not included in these vaccinations. Therefore, a so-called compensatory epidemic occurred: the disease mainly attacked men aged 19-24 and slightly older from 25 to 28 years old.", "redacted": 1}

I tried to initiate a conversation myself, listing further symptoms, medical history, problems, and questions I had, but unfortunately, there was no response or interest. Finally, when I finished my monologue, the doctor told me to prepare for an abdominal ultrasound, which was performed quite painfully by pressing the ultrasound probe hard against my abdomen; I should add that previous ultrasounds I had were not as painful. I brought results with me, which the doctor only glanced at. Summarizing the visit—I left the office with a more current ultrasound and the information that the doctor didn't see anything, and I need to have a gastroscopy. Interview—none, assessment during ultrasound or conclusions—none, interest in the patient—none, just a referral for further tests and that's it. I expected more from a doctor of this \"caliber.\" The only relief after this visit was that I didn't pay 160 PLN for it thanks to additional medical coverage I have at work.

And in case of smog? You need to check the results of particulate matter concentration monitoring, use a working HEPA filter in the car, and when walking, an appropriate mask (not a surgical one!), use an air purifier at home—he added. As Prof. Jan Kowalski, the national consultant in environmental health, pointed out, there is evidence that reducing exposure to particulates can improve health.

{"opinion_id": "op_000394", "lang": "en", "text": "Prof. Jan Kowalski from the Department of Biophysics and Molecular Physics at the University of Silesia has been working on amorphous pharmaceuticals for over a dozen years. \"Over 35% of medicinal substances currently available on the market are characterized by low bioavailability resulting from the poor solubility of these drugs. Moreover, it is estimated that over 70% of new compounds with huge potential to become pharmaceuticals will be rejected during the research and development process precisely due to their poor water solubility,\" he explained in an interview with PAP. This concerns drugs in solid form—i.e., tablets, pellets, or capsules. One of the more effective methods that can improve the bioavailability of the active substances contained in them is converting them to the so-called amorphous form. Amorphous bodies combine certain features of solids and liquids—a substance in an amorphous state is a solid, but the molecules forming it are arranged chaotically, which more resembles a liquid.", "redacted": 1}
