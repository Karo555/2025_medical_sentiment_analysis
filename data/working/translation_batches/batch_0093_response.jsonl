I was already in such a situation that I couldn't fight it on my own, even though I was aware that it was dragging me down, taking so much time that I could have devoted to a normal life, leaving an emotional void and constant self-reproach about why I am the way I am even though I don't want to live like that. I thank Providence that I came across Pani Anna. And I thank Pani Anna for helping me, for being understanding, non-judgmental, and comprehending my situation. After the first visit, she made me able to leave the office and feel like a normal guy, to gain faith in myself. Of course, it wasn't easy; there were ups and downs.

That was the opinion I had of Pani doktor after visits before getting pregnant. However, everything changed the moment Pani doktor told me to prepare for a miscarriage because, in her opinion, there was no point or basis to do anything. When I asked about some pregnancy-sustaining medications, I was told that a miscarriage at 5 weeks is so normal that nothing is done... Honestly... I left the office crying. I changed doctors, got medication, and I'm enjoying the beginnings of the 20th week. Everything is possible if the patient's well-being is truly considered, even that of the smallest one.

I was at Pani doktor at Baby Clinic with my 11-month-old daughter, who has a few flaky, evidently non-itchy spots on her calves. Pani doktor examined the changes in semi-darkness—she didn't bother to open the window or turn on the light—and stated that my daughter has delicate skin that might have dried out, leading to slight infections, for which she prescribed Chlorchinaldin H ointment, containing a steroid, which seems like a rather bold move at the start of treatment—in my opinion, steroids should be a last resort, especially for such a young child. Additionally, the ointment leaflet clearly states that it is contraindicated for children under 12 years of age. Furthermore, my daughter sometimes scratches her ears quite hard, and ENT causes were ruled out, so we were referred to a dermatologist—Pani doktor only looked at one ear, stating that there might be slight redness, but it's quite dark, so it's hard to see well, and it might just be blood vessels, and we can also apply the aforementioned ointment to the ear. In my opinion, money thrown down the drain; I do not recommend.", "redacted": 0}

For esophageal swelling diagnosed privately at another facility after being recommended this test by the treating pediatrician, besides nonchalant ignorance, Pan Jan Kowalski prescribed medication for constipation and a follow-up visit in a year, adding on the way out, in the child's presence, that if the esophagus shortens due to the aforementioned swelling, nowadays IT is surgically removed. -> What", "redacted": 2}

{"opinion_id": "op_001850", "lang": "en", "text": "Hello, 7 months ago I had the honor of meeting Pani dr. However, before I ended up at the dental office run by Pani dr., I visited 2 clinics in Germany, specifically in Hanover; they proposed removing 3 teeth, including one incisor. (advanced periodontitis, untreated teeth) there was no longer any talk of any temporary solutions. Extraction seemed unavoidable already, even considering that the aforementioned dentists had been unanimous about it, so I was surprised when Pani doktor attempted to save my teeth. After the first visits, I was surprised by the expertise and professionalism but also realized that I could trust both Pani Doktor and the staff, who competently coordinate the entire office logistics, scheduling appointment times according to the patient's needs and possibilities, confirming and reminding by phone the day before the visit, which is important for a patient leading a professionally intense lifestyle. I can assure you that my teeth were saved, even though the treatment is not yet over, thanks to the procedures and prophylaxis that were recommended to me. (Pani Dr. found the time) to make me understand that the effectiveness of the treatment does not depend solely on her. Those of you who have had the opportunity to be in dental offices in Germany, Holland, or Belgium will certainly be convinced that this office worthily represents not only Poland but also Europe. Moreover, the treatment is professional, effective, painless, and this is because the doctor practices her profession with passion and vocation, and has an innate talent for it. Therefore, I can, with a clear conscience, recommend the Awansdent Office to everyone, even in seemingly hopeless situations. In case of doubts, I can provide my email to interested parties.

If everything goes well, it's okay, but if there are complications, it's hard to count on help in the hospital from doctors for whom we are strangers. That was the case with me. I was at the end of the 41st week of pregnancy and had no symptoms that I was going to give birth. No one could take care of me. Fortunately, in time, Dr. Anna Kowalska took care of me. She saved the life of me and my son. She started acting, not like others who told me to wait. I had a cesarean section. For that, I thank her very much.

{"opinion_id": "op_001858", "lang": "en", "text": "Great hopes are still placed in molecularly targeted therapies. As explained to PAP by Prof. Jan Kowalski, these drugs are today available worldwide for about 10-15% of patients with so-called non-small cell lung cancer (which constitutes about 80% of lung cancer cases – PAP). These are patients with a so-called activating mutation of the EGFR gene or possessing a so-called EML4-ALK fusion gene. By administering molecularly targeted drugs to them, not only can their life be extended, but its quality can also be improved.
