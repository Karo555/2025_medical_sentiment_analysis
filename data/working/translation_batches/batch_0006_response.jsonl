Admittedly, sometimes he is terribly artificial with that smile of his and diminutives - probably due to routine, but the important thing is that he tries to create a good atmosphere. Most of his patients are children, and after over a dozen years of working with them, I would also smile through gritted teeth ;) When it comes to using force, I consider it an advantage. In several cases, by applying more force, he performed procedures more efficiently with a decisive movement, for example, removing an arch. I prefer that over tugging for several minutes...

The treatment itself takes a very long time, the doctor has a different opinion about the treatment at every visit, and when we were at the first visit, I was delighted - I heard about the course of wearing braces, about not extracting teeth because the palate would be expanded, then about a special mask to wear, and now I don't know the treatment process, and none of the things mentioned earlier are happening.

The doctor diagnosed my illness in 5 minutes without explaining where it came from, what the risks are, or what it entails. Questions were met with reluctance and her scaring me that I had contracted a serious illness... after the visit, I ran out of the office crying and turned to the internet where I found out that it is a harmless, quite common condition.

However, this is just the beginning of further research. \"Everything depends on the databases we work with. If the set is large, the network will make mistakes very rarely, even with an increased number of analyzed species,\" says Dr. Jan Kowalski. For now, the algorithm can determine which species it is dealing with when analyzing an image containing only one type of microorganism. The stages of multiplication and isolation are therefore still necessary. The next step, however, will be to teach the algorithm to recognize bacteria much faster – directly in the material collected from the patient. According to scientists from Jagiellonian University, this is feasible. However, it requires expanding the database and further work on the proposed solution.", "redacted": 1}
