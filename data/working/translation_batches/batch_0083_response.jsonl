Additionally, she ground my lower even teeth so crookedly for the crowns that it is far from the concept of aesthetic dentistry, let alone comfort in life. \"Preventive caries treatment\" unfortunately usually means pushing for unnecessary treatment, and very expensive at that. I regret that I did not consult what the doctor said with another dentist. I would probably have avoided the pain that continues to this day after the treatment in the office. After placing the crowns, for which I had to have healthy teeth, just a few months later during one of the check-ups, she said that I have caries on other teeth, which unfortunately I let her treat. And in this way, from non-painful teeth, the doctor caused my entire bite to change, my whole jaw constantly hurts, I cannot chew regular meals, not to mention hard products, and these \"treated\" teeth have been hurting me constantly since the moment they were \"treated for caries,\" that is, for over several months. Wanting to improve the aesthetics of two upper teeth, the doctor additionally damaged several healthy ones on the bottom and said that it is \"normal\" preparation for crowns. I regret that I agreed to it and let her grind the bottom, because because of that my bite changed, and I did not think it would be such a big interference with the teeth and such strong grinding of my previously straight teeth, which are now crooked and painful, because the doctor was focused on doing it as quickly as possible, not as best as possible. Before all this treatment, I felt no pain, and after the \"treatment,\" I feel it constantly. I would rather give this money away for free than treat it again in the doctor's office. Despite many corrections, the doctor could not fix my teeth. Getting treated here is the worst decision I have made, with which I will unfortunately have to suffer for a long time. I suggest consulting the treatment plan recommended by the doctor with another dentist, preferably a trusted one. I unfortunately ended up here by chance and certainly do not want to go back. I do not recommend.", "redacted": 0}

If I had not insisted during the follow-up visit that something was wrong and it was not likely to improve because, as the doctor said, \"it might resolve on its own,\" he probably would not have taken an interest himself.

There are several categories of this disease: PH caused by congenital heart defects, in the course of lung diseases, with a multifactorial pathogenesis, chronic thromboembolic, and arterial pulmonary hypertension.

{"opinion_id": "op_001651", "lang": "en", "text": "Meetings with Mr. Jan in my case started at the beginning of the year. I don't like the stiff, office atmosphere, nor therapists who ostentatiously glance at the clock towards the end of the conversation. That's why I'm glad there is an option to meet with the therapist in a more intimate space, over coffee, calmly, in a normal non-office atmosphere (the office one personally gives me extra stress). We've had several (maybe a dozen) sessions. What I personally liked the most are the elements of provocative therapy, which Mr. Jan uses increasingly in his sessions (if you don't know it - I encourage reading about it, a very bold and interesting way of conducting therapy). There are no taboo topics in these sessions - you can talk honestly about everything, bring up any nagging problem. Another very important element of therapy with Mr. Jan is interaction. He is a person who listens actively, responds, delves into the topic, is one hundred percent focused on what is happening in therapy (I've had meetings with a therapist who sat like a log and minutes of silence between us gave me a fever). To sum up - I highly recommend. If you don't know how to say something, Mr. Jan will find a way - in my case it was pouring some matters onto paper. There is one more huge advantage of this therapist - honesty. If Mr. Jan sees that it's better, that the self-work is progressing, he suggests meetings with less frequency.", "redacted": 2}

As for the head, it turned out that the baby has a slightly larger head, but there is no talk of any hydrocephalus, which was also confirmed yesterday at the clinic. As I found out from the neurologist, Dr. Jan Kowalski MEASURED THE HEAD WRONG! Actually, the corners in the head, that's why he got hydrocephalus. Sorry, but I somehow believe 5 doctors more than one!
