I know several girls who are delighted with him and don't worry about the talk, they are just well treated and feel and look better so I don't know but one thing is certain we don't have good doctors so you have to choose one and there are worse ones so there's no point in insulting him just change the doctor and everyone will go where they think is right.

{"opinion_id": "op_003222", "lang": "en", "text": "I decided to visit Dr. Anna Kowalska for two reasons. First, good reviews, second, she conducts periodontological consultations and informs that she deals with gum diseases, oral cavity and mucous membranes. Unfortunately, such a specialist is hard to find, so I decided to trust as the price in the price list was not too high. The doctor may have knowledge in this field, but it is very general and equal to generally available - non-medical knowledge. Regarding my problems, I did not learn anything new at all and nothing that would go beyond stating that there is a problem but you don't need to be a specialist for that. The consultation seemed to consist of stating that my problem does not look good and I need to go somewhere else for advice (offering several doctors from other, distant cities). The office itself, located in a house, leaves much to be desired. I did not feel comfortable in it, and cleanliness was not at a high level. Another issue is the doctor's punctuality. Despite scheduling an appointment for a specific time, I was not admitted, and instead of me, another patient entered. When using private services, there should be a certain standard, after all, we pay for it. And regarding payment, another issue is the doctor charging me a higher price for the service than was in the price list during registration for the visit without prior informing that the price would be higher. Personally, I do not recommend and even advise against, especially for people who have a more serious problem. The visit was a waste of time and money for me.", "redacted": 1}

He has one flaw - he doesn't sweet-talk anyone, which I consider an advantage. He speaks directly and decisively to everyone about what the problem is. This doesn't please some patients. I'm sorry but I don't want to offend anyone - it particularly doesn't please \"fat and lazy ladies\" who blame the doctor for their own lack of consistency. As for the rest, everyone has a different opinion. Some are satisfied, others are not. I trust this doctor and recommend him", "redacted": 0}

I started calling various clinics, until I finally got through to a long one :) When I got through to the reception, the lady said that Dr. Jan Kowalski was standing right next to her so she handed him the phone. Instead of making me wait for months in the queue for the National Health Fund, the doctor told me to come with the results the next morning. It was funny, amazing humor, positive approach and respect for the patient. He immediately ordered a Holter monitor and a stress test. Unfortunately, before I could do them, I ended up in the hospital, just at the time when the doctor was on vacation. At the long one, they did the Holter monitor, after which I went with the results to Dr. Jan Kowalski, and I said that in 2 weeks I'm going to a Bon Jovi concert and I want to live to see it. It turned out that the doctor is also going to this concert. But back to the point. Some time later, I ended up in the hospital again on the cardiology ward. The doctor insisted on doing an electrophysiological test and I ended up with Dr. Jan Kowalski again. There were such laughs during the procedure that I remember it with a smile on my face :) Unfortunately, it is still not known where my tachycardias come from, but I know that Dr. Jan Kowalski is concrete and if my ailments had a cardiological basis, he would definitely find them. I recommend this doctor with a clear conscience :) Jan", "redacted": 3}

Generally, it's not about the money, but about all that fear and anxiety we went through, not knowing what was really happening with the little one.

So I signed up for a visit to Dr. Jan Kowalski based on online reviews. I can now state that all my visits were conducted in a rush because each time there was at least an hour's delay as the doctor was always late. Such a situation should not take place considering that each time you have to pay appropriately for the visit. During the entire pregnancy, I had about 13 visits after which the doctor didn't even remember my name. With a clear conscience, I can say that the doctor is nice, he performed the examination in a gentle manner. Unfortunately, the visits lasted only a few minutes in total, the doctor forgot to write prescriptions because he was always in a rush. The worst thing is that due to this rush and distraction, he misinterpreted the test results which could have resulted in damage to the fetus. When, after my overzealousness, it finally came out that the results were bad and it was due to the doctor's carelessness, I didn't even hear an apology. Not recommended.", "redacted": 1}

Paying 500 zł for a visit, you expect something more from a doctor than just a referral to the hospital. This is really not small money. I was operated on for Haller - 2 times and when the 3rd operation was to take place, I suddenly heard two days before the operation that there are no benefits for me. Not to mention that the 2 (cosmetic) operations didn't help me at all, and the abscess kept growing. That wasn't the worst, only the professor's memory. He completely didn't remember that he supposedly operated on me and that I had been to him for private visits. The prof thought this was to be my first operation.

{"opinion_id": "op_003232", "lang": "en", "text": "I would like to thank Dr. Jan Kowalski for my new left knee and to really show that this is not such an ordinary left knee a few words of introduction. I am sick with a severe form of hemophilia A. This is a disease characterized by bleeding into the joints after the smallest injuries or even spontaneous ones in the severe form of hemophilia as was the case with me. Hundreds of bleeds completely destroyed my knee joint leading to a very large bowing of the leg. An additional difficulty and obstacle in performing the operation were leg ulcers - occurring in hemophilia as a side effect of poor blood circulation in the legs. Only Dr. Jan Kowalski undertook to insert a prosthesis in me along with a bone transplant - in my case it was necessary due to the complete destruction of the joint. As you can see, total driving on the edge without holding on!!! For me, Dr. Jan Kowalski is an ABSOLUTE UNIQUE, both as a person and as a doctor - the first of this class among the doctors I have met, and being treated for several decades I have met quite a few. High culture, commitment, knowledge, professionalism, precision in action on the operating table. And all this combined with great kindness, ordinary human approach to the patient, care for him before and after the operation which gives a great sense of security. Dr. Jan Kowalski always has time for the patient, does not know the words no, I can't, I can't manage, I don't have time, I can't do anything about it - he is simply a true enthusiast, full medical professionalism and human empathy - and thus a true medical calling. I apologize for this long post but I included absolutely the very essence and the impossible becomes possible. I had the operation on 18.11.2010 and there is a real chance that after rehabilitation this year I will start walking without crutches - thank you again Dr. Jan Kowalski for the new left knee.

The only inconvenience is walking in tight compression stockings but that's nothing compared to the previous operation.

The visit was express. To my questions whether I should take any vitamins, do any tests, somehow prepare to get pregnant, the only answer I heard was that \"I should not panic\" and I should \"hug my husband tightly\". From the experience of my sisters, I know that they had tests done, among others, for hormones, took vitamins, folic acid and followed a healthy diet. Because that's what their gynecologists told them. When I asked about it directly, he stated that it is completely unnecessary but if I insist I can do some tests. He did the ultrasound only because I asked for it. I think this is a very unprofessional approach to the patient. Wasted money and time.
