The dietitian gives lots of great advice, sometimes small ones, which are a discovery even for people interested in healthy food. The effects were huge after the first visit, and each subsequent one is another discovery of new, effective tips. I have never been so satisfied with collaboration with a dietitian and never had such results. I'm losing kilograms, fat, including visceral fat, gaining muscles and well-being. I highly recommend.", "lang": "en"}

Without arrogance, with a huge amount of knowledge and a human approach. Finally, I feel I am on the right path. I recommend with all my heart!", "lang": "en"}
