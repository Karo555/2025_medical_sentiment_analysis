A.: In Poland, opinions have emerged that we are supporters and promoters of polyphasic sleep, but we only want to give people the opportunity to switch to polyphasic sleep. We always emphasize that the healthiest is 9-hour sleep and nothing can replace it. However, there are moments in a person's life when it is difficult to sleep 9 hours. Therefore, our device can help stabilize sleep so that it always benefits us. If someone regularly sleeps 4 hours because their work allows it, arguments to sleep 9 hours because it is healthy will not appeal to them. We need to find a solution to help them optimize those 4 hours. PAP: Who is the device primarily intended for?", "lang": "en"}

Everything went smoothly, she did not let on that something might be wrong, thanks to which I did not panic. And although it was my fourth birth, her care, management of the entire delivery, and constant informing me of what was happening, instructing me what and how to do, were priceless to me. She was the first to protect my perineum, thanks to which I could sit almost immediately after giving birth. She also gave me a lot of decision-making power during childbirth. Thank you very much once again! I warmly recommend Pani Zuzanna!", "lang": "en"}

I was with Pan Doktor with my daughter, who is primarily \"afraid\" of doctors :-) I should add that it was our first time today!!! It was fantastic at Pan Doktor's! He talked with the child, got her interested, explained what he would do. All activities related to examining the child proceeded slowly, calmly, without stress and without watching the clock. Pan Doktor gave us as much time as we needed. He dispelled doubts, advised, and what was particularly important was that he listened to us as Parents!!! This rarely happens among doctors!!! Panie Doktorze, thank you for your expertise, matter-of-factness, and professionalism in every way. I will definitely recommend you to all my acquaintances. At the moment, you are number one for me among doctors with an approach to young patients and among doctors who do their job with a calling!!!!!", "lang": "en"}

A person doesn't spend so much money to have to be treated and pay again after a year. A properly placed filling should last several good years. I wanted to have more serious procedures done after the treatment was finished, and other dentists stated that everything done by this Pani needs to be replaced... and it is not my fault. My parents, who were also treated by this Pani, also have everything to be corrected... No words! So much money for such a mess! An ordinary NHS dentist would have done it much better. These reviews are some vile advertisement, they have nothing to do with the truth. I do not recommend. Stay away from this practice.", "lang": "en"}

His calmness with which he approaches the patient makes us feel a blissful sense of security during a visit with him, despite great pain. After the exhaustive interview he conducts, he knows where the cause lies, and he hits it flawlessly, a bullseye every time. He explains everything in an understandable, simple language for us, even writing it down on paper, what is happening to us at a given moment. He always sees a way out of the situation.

{"opinion_id": "op_002887", "text": "I underwent a breast lift and shaping procedure. The left areola is disgustingly large, shapeless, and sagging downward, the right one is unnaturally pushed out and tight and significantly smaller than the left. More skin was left under the right breast, which under a push-up bra rolled up and went under the edge of the bra, which was felt and bothersome, and after taking off the bra it was visible because the skin turned outward. Dr Witwicki said picturesquely that it would get slashed. For the correction, I had to pay an extra 300 PLN. As the doctor stated, so that the nurses would feel like coming to work. When I came to remove the excess skin from under the right breast, the doctor asked \"what are we doing, eyelids?\". On the day of the procedure, the doctor stated that it was almost invisible and unnecessary because it would disappear after 4 months and that if I wanted another scar of my own free will, then by all means. He himself told me to wait 3 months for the correction and did not say that at the previous visit. Of course, the excess skin did not change and was bothersome. As for the other breast, he stated that he was not sure if it could be improved. I had the correction done under local anesthesia. I don't know how he applied the anesthesia or what, but twice he pierced skin that was not anesthetized and pulled the thread, at which I screamed in pain and pulled my hand out of the holder to reflexively grab the painful spot. At which the doctor started yelling, what was I doing, I wouldn't be able to have the procedure finished. A nightmare. On the left breast, I will get a tattoo. I have no other choice. Maybe others are luckier, but in my opinion, however, there is a lack of Dr. W.'s medical and human approach to the patient, at least towards me. I am surprised, embarrassed, and disgusted by this person's attitude towards me. I expected an apology, not being yelled at during the procedure. SHAME AND DISGUST.", "lang": "en"}

Ladies and gentlemen, let's not go crazy, I'm not going to keep the child in utter sterility at home when they will go to the sandbox anyway and put sand in their mouth. Another very irritating thing is that this doctor orders the patient themselves to write down what he says, this also applies to drug dosing. It's the first time I've encountered such treatment of a patient who pays 100 PLN for a visit anyway. In such a case, there can never be any reservations because \"if something happens\" the blame can be placed on the patient's poor note-taking.

It is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, which are important regulators of metabolism, growth, and development of the body. During pregnancy, the demand for iodine increases significantly, the amount of which in a woman's daily diet often becomes insufficient. Even a slight deficiency exposes her child to the risk of impaired cognitive function and lowered intelligence quotient. However, most mothers are not aware of the consequences of low iodine intake for their children's development. Experts claim that in many European countries that have voluntary iodine prophylaxis programs, up to 50% of newborns are exposed to a slight iodine deficiency, and thus to the risk of limiting their cognitive potential.
