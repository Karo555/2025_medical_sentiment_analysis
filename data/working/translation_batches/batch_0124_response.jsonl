{"opinion_id": "op_002463", "lang": "en", "text": "I don't recommend Dr. Anna Kowalska, I had two appointments with her, the second one only because she already knew my problem, and it was my first visit to a gynecologist in my life, so I wasn't sure if my stress made me remember the first visit so negatively - however the second one confirmed that it wasn't emotions, but the doctor's attitude that caused these feelings after the visit. The first visit was still \"somehow okay\" compared to the second one, where the doctor called me \"Kitty\" (okay, maybe I'm young, but at 20 I'd prefer not to be treated like a child, especially by a doctor), she didn't hide her outrage when I told her I didn't know at what point in my cycle the blood test was done (even though she had the results sheet in her hand, which stated that my last period was over 3 months ago, so I simply don't know how to interpret that, besides I had the impression she herself didn't know how to find out, but of course I might be wrong). Besides, she was snappy, unpleasant, and looked offended that I came with such a \"trivial\" problem as missing periods not caused by pregnancy. Regarding the treatment itself, I'm not a gynecologist, but I went to another doctor some time later who was surprised that I immediately got a prescription for birth control pills instead of lutein and another (herbal) medicine, which are healthier for the body and which actually helped, so I also have doubts about the doctor in this regard. The last thing, which might be understandable but surprised me a bit, is that the appointments were scheduled exactly a week apart, and at the second one the doctor didn't recognize me at all and was initially convinced it was my first time with her. I understand that a doctor isn't obligated to remember every patient's medical history, but in my opinion, if Dr. Anna Kowalska doesn't even remember by \"face\" a patient she examined a week earlier and sent for tests that she was supposed to perform herself (ultrasound) and interpret (blood test), it really shows the doctor's overall attitude towards the patient, which she additionally demonstrates throughout the entire visit. So I don't recommend her, especially for a first visit to a gynecologist, because it's easy to be laughed at for theoretically \"stupid questions\" that a gynecologist should answer without comment.", "redacted": 1}

The second time there was more fear due to an irresponsible and incompetent Doctor who scared me during a private visit that I had an adrenal gland tumor. And for the second time, tests were done, diagnosis was made, and appropriate medications were selected. I didn't go to the Doctor privately but found a place on the ward. I also didn't go to Dr. Jan Kowalski, who turned out to be a super specialist in his field. For me, Dr. Anna Kowalska is 100% professional. I can't imagine being patted on the head in the hospital. Dear people, this is a doctor, not a husband or wife who will say a kind word, hug and comfort. One needs to get used to the Doctor's manner. During both the previous and current stay, the Doctor was available to me, found time to talk in her office after the visit, and during the visit answered questions concretely and substantively. Is she arrogant? Cheeky? Unavailable? Doesn't respect people and sees them as money machines during private visits? I can't say that about the Doctor. These are opinions of people who are simply healthy, feel sorry for themselves, and blame all evil on the Doctor. If I ever need treatment for endocrine disorders, it's only with Dr. Anna Kowalska and her wonderful team on the internal diseases ward at the Military Hospital.
