Of course, the diagnosis was incorrect; a regular soothing and regenerating cream didn't help because the rash kept spreading.

I had a completely different idea of what a visit to a dentist who treats young children, especially those with high anxiety levels, would be like. Upon entering the office with my child, we didn't even have time to adapt, and the check-up and procedure were done forcefully. The doctor didn't even try to talk to the child, smile, or explain what she was going to do—she just did what she had to do, ignoring the child's terror, screams, and crying. So the atmosphere was far from pleasant. I'm glad this nightmare is over, and I can definitely say we will never use Dr. Anna Kowalska's services again. I honestly do not recommend.", "redacted": 1}

The method of isolating stem cells from fetal tissues is known worldwide, safe, and scientifically described, but it raises ethical doubts in some circles. \"Usually, as doctors and scientists, we say that money limits us.

Currently, thanks to the introduction of new drugs, including immunotherapy, it is increasingly said that for many patients 'it will be a chronic disease'—notes Jan Kowalski. In his book, he cites examples of many other cancers in the treatment of which enormous progress has been made—chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer. He describes the experiences of many patients—including people known from the front pages of newspapers—who have either been cured of cancer or live with it as with another chronic disease. \"In the United States, there are already over 14 million people who have 'survived' cancer,\" writes the author of the book. 15% of them have lived at least 20 years since diagnosis.

Unfortunately, the choice of medications at the beginning of the treatment was not just unfortunate but very exaggerated. The doctor does not spare means and prescribes three steroid medications simultaneously as one course, which, as I now know from other doctors, is not advisable, especially when assessing the disease 'by eye,' and can lead to serious side effects. While taking the medications, everything was fine, but the side effect just three days after finishing was several times worse than at the beginning, downright pitiful; I had a large, swollen butterfly on my face in purple and red colors, covered with pustules as if sprinkled with flour.
