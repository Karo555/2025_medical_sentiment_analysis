I have a rather unusual health problem, on which unfortunately many specialists have failed. Mr. Jan Kowalski also did not manage to find a solution. That's fine, it happens. However, during this ineffective therapy, Mr. Jan Kowalski claimed that he knew perfectly well what was wrong with me. That I had a problem for which I should see a psychologist. He frightened me with very negative consequences of a possible surgical operation. He reacted with anger (or at least I perceived his reactions that way) when I reported great pain from his procedures, which, moreover, brought no improvement (it was even worse after a few sessions). Because therapy \"sometimes has to hurt.\" I left the last visit in tears. Many of his tips were certainly valuable, psychological therapy is also not a bad idea (although I don't know if it's key to my ailment), but his manner of contact with me was very unpleasant, and frightening me with the consequences of the disease progression was completely unnecessary. Especially since I later read a lot about the disease he \"diagnosed\" me with and those descriptions matched what I experience to a very small extent. Moreover, no other doctor confirmed these hypotheses. It's a pity that Mr. Jan Kowalski focused on pigeonholing my symptoms and their causes in a way that exceeded his competence, instead of honestly informing me that he simply could not help me.", "lang": "en"}

Today I have the impression that Mr. Dr. Jan Kowalski in most cases treats civilization diseases, forgetting that in today's times it is difficult for women to only wear skirts, not to mention cotton underwear and the prohibition of wearing tights : ) Additionally, after each visit, I felt guilty and left with the conviction that if I did not follow Mr. Dr. M.'s advice, I would not get pregnant...

The first visit filled me with hope, although I perceived Ms. Doctor's approach to us as very aloof and I had the impression that my child's crying distracted and annoyed her. We received a lot of medication for an amount exceeding PLN 200... from which after three weeks I see no result. Besides, the cost of the visit itself was PLN 200. I was persuaded to have skin tests, which are supposedly reliable after the child is 3 months old. So I showed up for the tests. We waited an hour for our turn, then we went in and I was even more disappointed. The lady performing the tests was impolite, rushing, snippy, and moreover, during the tests, she went out for a cigarette, leaving us alone in the office. But this opinion is not about her. After the tests, we were forced to wait for a visit with Ms. Doctor, because that's where you have to pay for the tests. The tests showed no allergies in the child. In the office, our visit literally lasted 5 minutes. We found out that the child is not allergic to anything, was weighed, that I should continue the treatment which still doesn't help, and introduce products that I had eliminated from my diet. After 5 minutes, I received two bills for the amount of PLN 200. So total 400.... PLN 200 for the tests and PLN 200 for that momentary summary. I felt cheated and ripped off. I am perfectly aware that it is a private visit but a brief consultation after the tests, to learn nothing new, should be included in the cost of performing them... I am at a standstill because the treatment does not help, even though I still keep the diet while breastfeeding (and I was supposed to introduce products. My daughter still regurgitates as before and still has rashes on her body.... And unfortunately, thanks to these visits, I no longer have the finances for further treatment. I suppose that treatment with Ms. Doctor is only for the more affluent, and I was just grasping at everything to help the child. After all, any mother would do the same.", "lang": "en"}

As she said, in France, such practices most often occur among employees in equivalent positions; cases of mobbing by a boss towards a subordinate are also frequent.

Influenza-like infections are most often caused by RS viruses,\" says Prof. Jan Kowalski. This is the most common pathogen causing upper respiratory tract infections, mainly in children. In adolescents and adults it usually runs mildly, but can be dangerous for the elderly. Prof. Adam Antczak recommends that primarily people over 65 years of age and young children under 2 years of age get vaccinated (the preparation can be given to children over six months of age). Also people suffering from chronic diseases: heart, lung, kidney, liver, blood diseases and diabetes, as well as those who have a weakened immune system.

Year after year my complex still exists. There is no hump anymore, but it is still ugly and moreover crooked. When I talk to people or with my partner... I try to subtly have my face twisted so as not to look directly. I am embarrassed by this crooked nose. I am ashamed to admit that the hump was removed, the tip was corrected, etc. (a correction of the entire nose was done), moreover, wearing glasses I cannot wear them for long because after the shaved hump, the cartilage was poorly shaved and a piece presses hard on the skin under the glasses causing pain. While having breast surgery with another doctor, I asked about the nose (but the doctor said he would not want to correct a nose after someone else... but he sees that it is crooked and \"the whole thing moves when touched\") Besides, I cannot afford another operation. I am just sorry that it was done this way and not another. It's not about whether it suits my face or not.
