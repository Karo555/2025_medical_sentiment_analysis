{"opinion_id": "op_001429", "lang": "en", "text": "The doctor conducted a long, detailed interview with me. After a few visits, I saw that she was not sure of her diagnosis but decided that I had a very serious disease and prescribed expensive medications (claiming that they are in no way harmful and can only help). I was a bit devastated and at the same time surprised because only two test results out of many came out not well. I decided to consult with another doctor just in case (one of the best I managed to find in Warsaw). The doctor firmly stated that there was no disease and even gave me a certificate for it (he said that exactly those two bad results also occur in healthy people). He also asked if I had been to an ophthalmologist before taking this medication because it can damage eyesight. In summary - Dr. Anna Kowalska gave me a wrong diagnosis, which caused me a lot of stress and wasted a lot of money, not to mention the health I could have lost by convincing myself of the disease and taking a medication with a serious side effect. I'm not saying I completely discourage a visit to Dr. Anna Kowalska, but I definitely advise taking her words into consideration and, in case of a bad diagnosis, verifying it again.", "redacted": 1}

One of the reasons is underfunding. In the 1940s in the USA, a model system conducive to innovation was developed: collaboration between the government, industry, and academic environments. According to Prof. Pączek, a multi-year plan is needed, independent of which party is in power. An example of such a solution is the Japanese plan to support innovativeness adopted in the 1990s. It yielded results only after over a dozen years, but the number of patents filed by leading universities increased many times. As Prof. Pączek emphasized, the primary importance is the credibility of scientific research.

During sleep, body temperature drops, the work of individual organs slows down, and the body's energy expenditure decreases. Sleep allows for general rest and regeneration. It ensures faster wound healing and enables memory consolidation. Thanks to it, we are able to function properly daily. \"Without sleep, one cannot live. We will die sooner from lack of sleep than from hunger\" - assured Anna Kowalska, then advised what to do to maximize the beneficial properties of sleep. The student stated that the most effective sleep is at night. This results from the construction of our biological clock. In the evening hours (around 21:00), the secretion of melatonin - the hormone responsible for the feeling of sleepiness - begins in our body, and this process lasts until morning (until around 7:30). It is precisely during this time that we should go to bed for several hours - preferably not less than 7.5 and not more than 9.", "redacted": 1}

As soon as we entered with our child into the office, we didn't even close the door properly, and the \"doctor\" asked what was wrong. And what was wrong was that our 4-year-old son had a terribly stuffy nose for a month, and a cough leading the child to vomit. After attempts at treatment by a pediatrician (supposedly some virus), I started looking for the cause of this condition. There was no fever, so doctors didn't prescribe antibiotics. We decided that it's best to go to an ENT specialist, and this one examined the throat, looked into the ears, and took us for a fiberoptic examination. He didn't say anything about this examination, didn't ask for my consent, just went into action and started putting a tube into the child's nose. Supposedly, anesthesia is given, but not in our case. After the examination, which showed that there is an enlarged pharyngeal tonsil and chronic disease of the palatine tonsils, the pseudo-doctor prescribed us, attention... a cough syrup, probably the 9th in a row. He said to treat the child and consider tonsil removal. I asked what I should treat him with, he gave me a prescription for an over-the-counter syrup. The night was terrible; the child cried, had breathing problems; in the morning, we called another doctor. This one, in turn, examined the nose traditionally, said that fiberoptics in such a state is an unreliable examination but PAID, DIAGNOSIS: purulent sinusitis, ear infection, the child very sick - treatment will be long, even 2 months, of course with antibiotics. A few days have passed; it's completely different; you can see that he is returning to health. I warn you, parents: he is unfriendly, zero approach to children, such a boor.
