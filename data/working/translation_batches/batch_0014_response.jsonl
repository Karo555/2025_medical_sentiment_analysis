I agree with previous patients that she tries to explain a lot to parents, but unfortunately I think she lacks approach to children.

Considering the nature of examinations in the office, I think a lot of delicacy is needed in approaching the child during the examination. As for treatment effectiveness, we cannot comment yet, we'll see.", "redacted": 0}

Other universities submit their programs for evaluation to, among others, the Polish Accreditation Commission. According to Kudrycka, representatives of the diagnosticians' community could establish a commission within their environment to evaluate study programs in medical analytics. Additionally, during the Health Commission meeting, the community's opposition was sparked by the proposal in the draft amendment from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education that universities could credit knowledge and skills acquired through professional work, courses or training towards studies. \"It won't be that someone from outside comes, puts down a paper and says 'I know this'. The university must create a commission that will assess and verify whether these are the same competencies taught during studies. If they are identical competencies, then that subject or module can be credited towards studies\" - explained Deputy Minister of Science Daria Lipińska-Nałęcz to the MPs.", "redacted": 2}

I've also been to various gynecologists from the National Health Fund and got zero diagnosis and consequently zero treatment... Following my future mother-in-law's suggestion, I went for a consultation with another gynecologist from the National Health Fund who said this disease cannot be treated at the clinic and gave me a business card for another doctor, namely Grochowicz, who apparently specializes in infertility treatment. Maybe the reviews aren't that good, but next month I'll go to him for consultation and clarification of some doubts, maybe he'll calm me down a bit...

I consider the stay at the hospital in Bytom under the female doctor's care as positive. The care for children really has nothing to complain about, all the nurses were nice and polite, willing to help. Most importantly, the procedure went well, it's much better after the procedure.

The visit with a small child lasted about 15 minutes during which time nurses entered the office with prescriptions to sign which took about 5 minutes, so the entire visit lasted about 10 minutes. During this time the doctor diagnosed the child with atopic dermatitis. However, he didn't provide the causes of this condition nor indicated how to treat it, he only gave phone numbers to his doctor friends to consult further treatment. After the visit which cost 100 zł, I expected something more but I didn't learn anything beyond what I knew before entering the office. The male doctor's knowledge may be sufficient for adults but he completely cannot handle problems of small children. Atopic dermatitis exceeded the capabilities, experience and knowledge of the doctor - provincial consultant in allergology and court expert in allergology and internal diseases.

{"opinion_id": "op_000271", "lang": "en", "text": "I used Anna Kowalska's services several times, but I wasn't completely satisfied with their quality, currently I use a different clinic. Closing blood vessels with electrocoagulation left many scars. I gave up on this method. Botox - basically no objections except the price, I pay much less now for the same thing. Laser removal of discolorations - no objections. The female doctor persistently tried to persuade me to do Cosmelan downplaying the fact that I have vascular skin. She said we could just close the blood vessels afterwards. But unfortunately during the second laser procedure, which was a correction and was supposed to remove scars, the female doctor \"got carried away\" and damaged healthy skin, leaving a large scar. Fillers: once administered perfectly, the next time after corrections there remained indentations, dimples. Besides, currently much better anesthetics are used than Emla cream (which in this clinic seems to be the only anesthetic used). Anna Kowalska persuaded me to do mesotherapy. Unfortunately there was no effect at all. At the next visit the female doctor was surprised how she could even suggest meso since this procedure makes no sense in my case and only standard filler can help. I wasted 700 zł unnecessarily, was swollen for 2 weeks and all for nothing. I decided that further use of the female doctor's services makes no sense, because she fixes one thing and damages another and it would go on endlessly. And besides it would cost a lot because services in this clinic are not cheap. The approach to patients may suit some but not others, I feel more comfortable in the clinic I currently use. The clinic itself and waiting room are small, usually crowded like in a public clinic, lacking elegance and coziness. I always felt like just another client, and in places where I pay substantial money for services I expect higher level treatment. In my opinion, service quality is inadequate to their price. In Wrocław there are better clinics with much higher service standards for the same money.", "redacted": 2}

Before the first visit I was like the nightmare from your dreams. Now hope has appeared for returning to the life of the gold king. I'm still in the process of treating anxiety neurosis, but I already feel improvement. Mr. Jan Kowalski eliminated my previous doctor's medications (escile) from my bloodstream and convinced me about a beautiful medication called sertagen. Initially I was negatively disposed to these pills due to the big label in the leaflet PSYCHOTROPIC... Unlike other \"doctors\" and physicians, Mr. Jan Kowalski explained to me in detail how the medication works on neurotransmitters. He dispelled all doubts raised by the medication leaflet, answering all my questions. A visit with Mr. Adam is not just treatment, but also a medical-biological lesson. A person swallows pills completely differently when knowing their exact mechanism of action. Thanks to Mr. Jan Kowalski I no longer feel anxiety every time: I can boldly slide down the water slide in \"aquaswer\", even with a man-eating shark under my arm. Previously (due to nervous issues and on other medications) I thought I was having a heart attack when I was at the first turn of the fourth drainage pipe. I check my pulse much less frequently because I feel that I'm alive. Sudden anxiety no longer shatters my thoughts so much. I can calmly perform household chores like laundry vacuuming. Anxiety attacks are already less scary to me. Getting to know sertagen better, I'm slowly managing to move away from afobram and everything is on the right track towards freedom from panic attacks. Work outside home is still prevented by continuous fear of an anxiety attack, but I think after jumping to 250 sertagen I'll live normally again and everything will pass... Mr. Jan Kowalski can excellently match medications, knows their quality and effects on other patients perfectly. As the only doctor I've met, he responds to texts and advises what to do, how to do it, what to undertake to make it better... With Mr. Jan Kowalski one can speak calmly. Stress-free tell your stories and talk about all matters and reasons for your health condition. Thank you Doctor for your patience and warm greetings. Probably if I had used sertagen properly from the beginning, I would already be at 100% with higher rotations than an automatic washing machine with a head washed clean of all anxieties. visit 6/6 patience 6/6 patient contact 6/6 engagement 6/6 effects 6/6", "redacted": 3}

Thanks to Dr. Jan Kowalski a person knows what to do to stop disease progression, thanks to ordered diagnostics a new different condition was caught in the initial stage, which doesn't give symptoms at this stage. At the end of examination he says his piece about the disease quite accurately, if a person wants to learn something, confirm, ask, he calmly answers, without nerves, dispels doubts.
