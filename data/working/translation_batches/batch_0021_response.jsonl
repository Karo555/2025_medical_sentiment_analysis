Sensitivity is the probability of obtaining a positive test result among sick patients. High sensitivity means missing few sick patients. On the other hand, specificity means the probability of obtaining a negative test result among patients not suffering from the diagnosed disease. High specificity means a lack of false positive indications (the test does not indicate healthy patients as sick). The sensitivity and specificity of thermographic examination obtained in the study were 72% and 58%, respectively. The BRASTER tester achieved even better results in women aged 50 and older.

There they were performed by plastic surgeons (Dr. Dudkiewicz, as far as I know, is a maxillofacial surgeon) and they did not bring any improvement to my appearance. After the surgery performed by Prof. Anna Kowalska, my appearance improved significantly. The tip of the nose was significantly raised (it still leans slightly to the left) and the lip has a fairly regular appearance. Initially, I was not satisfied with the lip surgery and was even embittered. My lips became smaller and took on a beak-like shape. Before the surgery, there was no talk of lip modeling (dozens of incisions and sutures underneath). I thought it was swelling. Meanwhile, at the follow-up visit, the Professor said they were nice and the swelling had practically subsided. I said I looked comical with such lips, and the professor said nicely. I was devastated; acquaintances grimaced when I asked how it looked. For over a month, the situation did not improve. Fortunately, it turned out that there was still a lot of that swelling and for reasons unknown to me, it lasted for so many weeks. The final effect turned out to be satisfactory. The lips took on a natural appearance. I also had a bone graft to the alveolar process done during the same surgery. I don't know if it took, but I suspect not because I still have a dent. It must be admitted that after harvesting bone from the hip, I was walking after 8 hours, and after a week I felt no pain at all.
