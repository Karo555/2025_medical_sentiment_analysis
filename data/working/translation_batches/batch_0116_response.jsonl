Like people because I wasn't treated like a human being. It's strange that as soon as negative comments and complaints appeared, the female doctor turned out to be a walking ideal. Grażyna's statements are strange, for example she writes in the masculine form: I still don't recommend, I warn against visiting this lady.

As a result of this process, called recombination, they can gain resistance to antibiotics or effectively resist the action of vaccines. Although the recombination process was discovered almost a hundred years ago, it was only thanks to DNA sequencing - a method that allows reading the genetic code - that we began to gain knowledge about how often this process occurs and what major changes it causes. Using fragments of DNA from bacterial strains, scientists can create an evolutionary family tree, showing when bacteria acquired new genes and how this affected their evolution. This knowledge is particularly useful in the analysis of pathogenic bacteria that we fight using vaccinations. Thanks to sequencing, we can analyze the evolution of bacteria and based on this information try to predict when and where strains resistant to antibiotics or insensitive to the action of vaccines will appear.", "redacted": 0}

I'll say this: I wanted to reduce my bust, and since I don't have typical gigantomastia and the size doesn't threaten my spine, I felt treated a bit... not to say unseriously, because that's too strong a word, but very \"lightly\". I had the impression that the doctor even tried to discourage me a bit, which I didn't like. Because after all, when someone wants to get silicone implants, they also don't do it for health reasons, but because they have such a need, and I haven't heard of anyone being discouraged from breast enlargement, while reduction is like some crime against humanity. Anyway :) I won't dwell on that.

{"opinion_id": "op_002315", "lang": "en", "text": "The visit to the female Doctor was not the most pleasant. I have been to many doctors but I have NEVER met such a person. I confirm another person's opinion that the female Doctor is mentally elsewhere, gets lost, doesn't have divided attention. Without going into details, the visit ended unpleasantly. I think one of the reasons was too many questions which apparently the female Doctor couldn't handle, so the visit ended unfavorably - I just wasted about an hour and a half. I asked many questions because the female Doctor's instructions somewhat conflicted with the remarks of other specialist doctors, so I had many doubts and expected clarification of certain issues. The female Doctor spoke rather chaotically and gave off-topic answers. She quickly got nervous and indignant. When we come to a doctor we come primarily to a human being with a specific medical specialization with a request for help in diagnosing a specific problem, which is not always simple and the opinion of one doctor - specialist may not be enough, sometimes consultation with other specialists is needed for example. However, the female Doctor did not handle the problem, and nerves or being offended at the patient is probably not the most appropriate solution. For me this visit was a huge disappointment, because I was counting on a reliable approach to the problem I have been struggling with for over 7 years. The female Doctor's approach to me as a patient and as a human being was at least inappropriate. I wanted to receive specific guidance and diagnosis, but despite some good opinions I cannot recommend this doctor.", "redacted": 0}

My Mom has been treated for diabetes for many years, the disease intensified recently and insulin had to be introduced. The doctor who had been treating my Mom until now was unable to convince her to take insulin, which very negatively affected her health, sugars went wild, in addition sensory neuropathy appeared and consequently problems with a diabetic foot began. As a result, Mom was taking very large amounts of medication and regularly had to go to the surgical clinic for dressing changes. Treatment costs increased, health condition worsened, and the wound wasn't healing... And when I was already devastated and losing hope, a friend at the diabetes clinic recommended Dr. Chęciński to me. After a visit to the male doctor my Mom was convinced to take insulin! After such a long time, after hundreds of conversations, no one was able to convince Mom to take insulin, and one visit to Dr. Chęciński was enough.
