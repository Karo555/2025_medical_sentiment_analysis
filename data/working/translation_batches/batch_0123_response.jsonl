He did the ultrasound himself and immediately directed me to surgery. He performed it himself. Everything happened quickly and I feel good. They removed my fallopian tube with the pregnancy.

And I won't leave it at that, I will file a written complaint about this doctor's behavior and if anyone would like to sign along with me, I think we can together change this arrogant person's conduct, because he is really a good doctor, he just learned that everyone humbly endures his comments.

Now I just hope that the teeth won't return to their old place otherwise I'll have to get braces again! Not to mention the queues and waiting time for an appointment... a nightmare for me...

I left very dissatisfied because I guess that's not how these consultations should look, especially since the next day I was at a consultation with another doctor, in another city and also without a breast ultrasound the doctor took precise measurements and we chose the shape and size together.

Specialist - super: very nice, cheerful, empathetic, treats the patient as a subject, nice sense of humor makes the patient not tense. The doctor is very approachable, his approach makes the person with the problem open up to him themselves (I'm writing about myself). The opinions below helped me a lot, I confirm their validity.

As for the approach to the patient, well... Setting a price range for the procedure is pointless, especially if at the visit you immediately dictate the amount from the upper limit. Moreover, for each dressing change I had to pay extra - 140 zł / change (there were several changes), even though the change itself lasted maybe 1 minute, and after getting home the dressing simply fell off. This was all the more strange for me because during various procedures that I had to perform in other offices, the dressing change is simply included in the price of the procedure, and that with the Doctor, I emphasize once again, was not low. The Doctor's friendly approach to the patient also varies, I personally did not experience friendliness. And the last issue, I was supposed to appear for a control visit (also paid), I called to ask if the histopathological test results were already available. It turned out they weren't. Therefore, I asked to postpone the visit to a time when the results would be available - I wanted to save my time and of course I didn't want to incur double visit costs. After 20 minutes I received a call and it turned out that the results were actually available, it was a bit strange for me, but I didn't delve into that issue anymore. The visit itself lasted maybe 2 minutes, it didn't take place in the doctor's office, but standing! in the room where I was supposed to have my dressing changed.", "redacted": 0}

The stimulator sends a \"portion of current\" to the brain every 15 minutes. Prof. Jan Kowalski explained earlier to PAP that this is to influence the increase in cerebral flow so that there is more nutritious blood, \"so that those neurons that survived the injuries in patients feel better, were better nourished\". Increasing cerebral flow and brain stimulation is consequently to lead to establishing contact with people who have so far been in a state of minimal consciousness.", "redacted": 1}

After 3 weeks I picked up the result and only because I have a medical education it seemed suspicious to me, because it in no way referred to the cytology result with which I was referred to the hospital. Dr. Jan Kowalski treated me like an idiot and simply lied straight to my face. After a few days of me seeking an explanation of the matter, I received a completely new result, with a completely different (much more serious) diagnosis and the old one got lost under strange circumstances. Of course Dr. Jan Kowalski immediately proposed to schedule me for a procedure. As it turned out after some time, when I had the test repeated privately, the result from the municipal hospital was untrue and any procedure unnecessary. I am 24 years old and this whole story cost me a lot of fear, nerves and almost loss of health.
