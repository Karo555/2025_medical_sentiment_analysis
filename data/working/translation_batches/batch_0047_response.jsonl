Dr. Anna Kowalska examined my bone conduction hearing and then stated that an MRI was needed, and with conviction diagnosed me with a tumor of the auditory nerve, i.e., an acoustic neuroma!!!! Meanwhile, I went to another doctor who prescribed me Cocarboxylase - the simplest medication! (in injections) and everything went away on its own. No neuroma to be seen or heard!

During the visit, the Doctor was slow, but I was happy because it meant he was thorough. He didn't have equipment in his office. He wanted to do an ultrasound on me, so he scheduled an appointment with me at the hospital. I live an hour from Olsztyn and have small children, so I can't always easily get away from home. I specifically came to the hospital and it turned out the doctor was operating. Okay, things happen. I came back a few hours later - he said he didn't have time and that I should come the next day. So I came for the third time and what happened? The doctor was operating again. I understand that's a doctor's job, that something can always come up, but if he also takes on private patients, knowing such situations can occur, he should, for example, take the patient's phone number to inform them that again he won't have time..... But as you can see, Dr. Jan Kowalski doesn't care about other people's time because he himself is the most important. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!", "redacted": 1}

The professionalism and huge commitment of Dr. Jan Kowalski resulted in saving part of the leg, with an amputation below the knee.

I owe it to Dr. Jan Kowalski and am greatly pleased that I have a healthy knee which gives me freedom of movement and reduces limitations in daily life.

I came to him after a, to put it mildly, averagely performed breast ultrasound elsewhere. \"Something\" pushed me to repeat this exam somewhere else - hard to say what - intuition, I guess, as nothing else comes to mind. It turned out, first, that I have two changes in my breast, not one as described on the first ultrasound, and second, that in my case, a BAC, which the first female doctor proposed, would give a reliable result in about 40%! Without going on too long, I'll just write that thanks to Dr. Jan Kowalski, I had both changes removed in express time. Today I got the results and I am happy. I want to recommend Dr. Jan Kowalski to all women. I am now his permanent patient and will run for breast ultrasounds every six months. I thank Dr. Jan Kowalski for the perfectly performed procedure, the patience with which he explained to me that everything would be okay, for being there and for doing what he was simply created to do.", "redacted": 4}

At subsequent meetings, I knew that I had done well by seeking help from a psychologist. It's been 3 months since the first visit and I have stopped blushing 80%. Thanks to therapy, I started to believe in myself and got used to having anxieties and complexes. Friends ask where is that quiet Anka who didn't speak up, who ran away from problems and blushed.

I dared to go; at the beginning everything was as it should be: examination, ordering appropriate tests, and finally diagnosis and starting treatment. I state that the treatment was poorly chosen because I felt better before taking the medication than after. And the second thing is that with each subsequent visit, the doctor did not examine me, just gave a prescription for which I paid 150 z≈Ç.

I note that it was a private visit, for which I paid. Dr. Jan Kowalski was clearly in a hurry somewhere and devoted only 30 seconds of his oh-so-precious time to my child to make a diagnosis.
