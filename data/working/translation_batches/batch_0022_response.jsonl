A good example is full-fat yogurt, which has a characteristic taste and texture.

We should wash our hands with soap and water, preferably warm and running. The water should not be hot, as it can dry out the skin on the hands. We should wash our hands using liquid soap rather than bar soap, because bar soap left on the sink remains moist, which promotes bacterial growth. We should dry our hands thoroughly. At home, where household members usually share the same microflora, we can use textile towels, which we change regularly. However, in public restrooms, we should dry our hands with paper towels. The use of hand dryers is not recommended. The warm air coming from them can stir up all the dust and microorganisms in the room. These will settle on our freshly washed hands.

Our research suggests that switching to organic products may to some extent increase the intake of these important nutrients,\" emphasizes Prof. Kowalski.

My only visit to her took place the day after taking a pregnancy test (positive result). Together with my husband (this is our first pregnancy), excited, we went for a visit to the gynecologist. The doctor during the ultrasound confirmed that I was indeed pregnant, and when both my husband and I cried tears of joy, she asked indignantly, 'Why are you crying?' Never mind. She prescribed me folic acid and told me to take no-spa plus hormones because I had abdominal pain. She told me to come back in two weeks. That's it! She didn't order any tests - neither blood nor hormonal tests, she didn't even measure my blood pressure! Oh, and she said that if I spotted, I shouldn't worry. Girls who defend 'the doctor' - is this professional behavior? A patient comes in her first pregnancy, says she has pain, and the doctor doesn't order any tests, doesn't talk, tells her to take no-spa and come back in two weeks - do you think that's okay? I left her office stressed, disappointed, confused, and with a sense of guilt for being pregnant! Fortunately, I now go to a doctor who is not only competent and communicative but also gives me a sense of security, and my pregnancy is progressing normally :)", "redacted": 0}

{"opinion_id": "op_000431", "lang": "en", "text": "As Dr. Anna Kowalska from the Faculty of Food Science at UWM in Olsztyn told PAP, sea buckthorn has not been widely known in Poland so far as a shrub bearing very healthy fruits. It was and is treated mainly as an ornamental plant that can be found in parks and on sea dunes. The medicinal values of the plant, whose orange and sometimes red fruits bead the branches like coral, are, however, widely known in Russia and Belarus. In Russia, scientists have patented about 100 different methods of using this plant. Medical literature describes the beneficial properties of sea buckthorn: it boosts the human body's immunity because it is one of the few plants that has stable vitamin C in its juice compared to other fruits. As Dr. Anna Kowalska explains, sea buckthorn fruit does not contain the enzyme ascorbinase, which contributes to the breakdown of vitamin C. Therefore, during thermal processing, the loss of vitamin C in sea buckthorn fruits is small.", "redacted": 1}

Yes, he is nice and friendly but not substantive. Yes, he refers for additional tests, but what good is that if he doesn't interpret them well. I had a blood test every month, but without the most important betaHCG, which would have allowed me to find out earlier that my pregnancy was not viable. He didn't order a Pap smear for me, and for additional tests, he sent me to his private office, which, horror of horrors, really resembles the early PRL times. After determining that the pregnancy was not viable, the doctor tried to blame me for the miscarriage, saying, 'And what did I say about not lifting!' Total lack of sensitivity and approach to the patient! After the miscarriage, he didn't refer me for additional tests; he even said, 'Why do you need those tests?' In my opinion, the doctor's approach to patients is unprofessional; he is not a good doctor, which is why I discourage him to all women. There are also rumors that he helps get rid of unwanted pregnancies by prescribing miscarriage pills. So how can he properly manage a pregnancy if he so easily disposes of new life? I also heard from him the statement that pregnancy starts from the 4th month! That probably speaks for itself! I will certainly never be his patient again!", "redacted": 1}

I don't know if some personal matters of the doctor influenced this or if it was an isolated case that day, but after reading the reviews, I had completely different expectations regarding this visit, and even if someone is late, they should apologize and not rush the examination.

The system is such that she admits several people at once, orders tests to be done by the receptionists, and the entire visit takes place in several parts. Dealing with so many people simultaneously, no one can properly attend to all patients, and that's what happened in my case. What does it matter that she is nice and smiling if along the way several unpleasant situations arose, one examination had to be done three times, the doctor herself was distracted, tried to convince me of something that didn't happen, constantly entered and left the office. The note with the names of drops and recommended tests was given to the receptionist, who couldn't explain to me why I should take those drops and what those tests were for... I also had to demand the certificate of the degree of vision defect from the optician because they tried to push expensive glasses on me on the spot.
