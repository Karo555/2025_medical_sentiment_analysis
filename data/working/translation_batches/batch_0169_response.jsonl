First, he \"detected\" an erosion in me for which he charged 700 PLN for removal, this was in 2004! 3 months earlier another gynecologist did not see this large erosion, then I thought that the other doctor was not a professional. Second, during pregnancy which unfortunately he managed, he did not order any tests, and when I forced him to, he resisted writing tests under the National Health Fund. He told me that from such tests you can only catch hepatitis! Besides, during one of the visits around the 16th week of pregnancy, he insisted on performing a colonoscopy for 150 PLN (this should not be done during pregnancy!), and at the next visit he simply forgot about it, which to me is proof that he wanted to scam me. And the worst thing. At 24 weeks of pregnancy, he disregarded an inflammation in me (despite me being there for it) and a day and a half after the visit with him, I gave birth due to infection caused by the inflammation.

I'm writing this opinion a long time after the surgery and rehabilitation.

He was 74 at the time and belonged to those who avoided doctors like fire. It was his first ever hospital visit as a patient. Fortunately, everything ended happily. After over two weeks he left the hospital, only it turned out that he also suffers from a severe form of COPD and will have to visit doctors. However, Grandpa didn't accept this. When his condition worsened, he breathed worse, started having problems climbing stairs, he finally forced himself to say that if he has to go to some doctor, then Dr. Jan Kowalski works on Skawińska. Everyone there was nice but he best explained to him what he suffers from and inspired his greatest trust. We went to Dr. Jan Kowalski's private office. Grandpa is very satisfied. Despite such a serious illness, he can still work in the garden which is the passion of his life. For our whole family, however, Dr. Jan Kowalski's greatest merit is convincing Grandpa to get a hearing aid. He claims he agreed to wear it to hear well what the doctor says to him and follow his recommendations because at a certain age you have to start treatment. Granddaughter Anna", "redacted": 3}

They were informed that the study concerned various methods of dealing with fatigue during physical exertion. They watched a recording in which a woman performed gestures such as shaking her leg, smiling, touching her face. The experimenter showed the participants a photo of a person practicing extreme sports. He asked how they combat fatigue and protect themselves from dehydration during sports activity.

For example, to examine whether I am fit for work in an administrative position, as the doctor himself stated - it is necessary to look at the breasts to check if they are not deformed.

So the doctor said that I could have been infected by him - implying that he might have more partners. I burned with shame and after receiving the prescription - I left the office. The doctor prescribed me Condyline - a strong agent that should burn off the growth. After 3 days of use, the medication did more harm than good, causing severe burns, bleeding, etc. Worried, I went to a venereologist/dermatologist for consultation. Despite the damage caused by the medication, the venereologist stated that this growth is simply my nature and there's nothing to worry about. He said it's 100% not HPV - especially since a year earlier I had a full set of tests at the oncology hospital. He also said that if the growth were actually condyloma, after applying the medication it would have fallen off or at least dried up, not burned the skin.

The child felt worse and worse, had more \"seizures\" and regressed more and more in development. We decided to consult a doctor from CZD in Warsaw. He immediately when he saw the child said that it is not epilepsy and the medication he is taking only intensifies his \"states\" (the child reacts so strongly to stress). Now we are not giving our son medications - he calmed down - \"anxiety states\" appear rarely because we limited his stress - our son is returning to himself but unfortunately still does not sit and does not drink from a bottle by himself even though he did it before taking the medication. No one will give us back the half year of life which we remember as a nightmare and what our son could have achieved in development if he hadn't taken that Keppra.
