Rothman studied the protein machinery and mechanisms that allow vesicles to reach the right place in the cell and connect with the appropriate part of it. Thomas C. Südhof, on the other hand, was interested in how transport looks in nerve cells. \"For him, neurotransmitters were the most important. He demonstrated a groundbreaking thing: for synaptic vesicle fusion to occur, calcium ion levels must be strictly controlled by appropriate proteins,\" added Prof. Wyroba.

In combination with other methods, it enables diagnostics for patients regardless of age, structure, and breast temperature. Therefore, contact thermography can streamline screening tests. The effectiveness and usefulness of the BRASTER Tester device in the diagnostics of breast gland pathologies were proven by a clinical trial completed in February. \"The liquid crystal state of matter was observed as early as the end of the 19th century, but it was only the 1960s that brought a decisive increase in interest in liquid crystals - especially when the property of changing the color of a thin layer of liquid crystal and their other no less interesting properties were discovered. The first LCD screens were developed as early as 1968. Liquid crystals have been the subject of interest and research work for many years in aspects of their applications in medicine,\" explains Dr. Jaremek, Vice President of BRASTER S.A.", "redacted": 0}

I must say, however, that he knows what he's talking about. I had arthroscopy 7 years ago, after which I was promised I would be playing basketball like before. Unfortunately, the knee was unstable right away. Sports - only with a brace. I thought it had to be that way. Two weeks ago I had an injury from basketball and a locked knee. The ultrasound showed that I have torn anterior cruciate ligaments. And the doctor confirmed it and announced a reconstruction surgery. I decided to wait in line for a procedure funded by the NFZ. I deserve something from them, since they botched the previous procedure. As for referrals - Dr. Luboiński does not have a contract with the NFZ, so he does not give referrals for magnetic resonance imaging. I won't delve into it. With a heavy heart, I paid for a private examination, which they performed practically overnight. 630 PLN at Avi Centrum. A visit costs 150 PLN each time, commercial surgery at the MSWiA clinic - 7 thousand. ha ha ha - I prefer to rely on the mercy of the NFZ.

I realize that the lady doctor has many patients and doesn't have time to get sentimental over each one, but she could at least devote a little bit and smile for hello. For me, she was aloof and unpleasant. To the two questions I asked, she answered very generally and with great resentment in her voice that I even dared to ask anything! I had been for ultrasounds with several other doctors before and I was never treated even half as badly. She is the worst gynecologist I have met so far - and I have dealt with many. Maybe she approaches patients with diseases differently, but I completely discourage girls in pregnancy from visiting this lady.
