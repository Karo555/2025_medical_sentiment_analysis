The price is affordable, 80 PLN. Most importantly, the visit brought results, without the need for follow-up visits, as was the case with our previous pediatrician.

{"opinion_id": "op_001985", "lang": "en", "text": "As Dr. Anna Kowalska explains, low molecular weight proteins can penetrate through the skin into its deeper layers. In this way, they influence the hydration and nourishment of the skin. On the other hand, high molecular weight proteins remain on the skin's surface. A thin but tight layer of cosmetic, the so-called occlusive film, prevents water loss. Properly hydrated skin looks healthier and younger, there are fewer wrinkles, and those that are visible are shallower. Thanks to their specific structure, proteins can form various forms, influencing the stability of the final product. This is important because cosmetics contain many diverse ingredients that interact and react with each other. The mixture, e.g., a gel or cream, must maintain an appropriate, constant consistency. Therefore, in developing new cosmetics, researchers must combine the necessary substances in such a way as to obtain durable products with a specific structure. A major challenge for the Krakow team was the fact that the new emulsion containing a whey protein concentrate consists solely of natural raw materials. Natural raw materials are characterized by less standardization compared to synthetic substances, meaning it's harder to establish a stable composition and proportions for the cosmetic.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_001986", "lang": "en", "text": "Hello. Regarding the course of the visit, I have no objections, but for me the most important thing is the result, which is why I'm only giving 2 stars. I got a small blood vessel under my nose. After taking a picture, the female doctor decided to effectively burn it off with a laser. Only after the procedure, which together with the visit cost me 200 PLN, did she say that if it doesn't work, I have to go to a surgeon. Of course, the procedure didn't work and now I have to look for a good surgeon. I didn't pay the female doctor 200 zloty for using the laser but for removing the blood vessel. She could have suggested right away that the laser might be ineffective, then maybe I would have given up on the procedure. Unfortunately, the money was thrown away.", "redacted": 0}

Towards the end of the meetings, Ms. Anna turned out to be biased, she couldn't control the course of the meetings, she didn't empathize with her patients' needs, she didn't stick to her principles. This led, among other things, to ending the meetings and summarizing a relationship of over ten years with one sentence. Finally, to make matters worse, she suggested conducting mediation :). Ms. Anna, I started fighting for our relationship on my own, but I tell you, it's hard work when the other person has been convinced by you that they have no faults and that they did everything they could (which wasn't true at all).

{"opinion_id": "op_001992", "lang": "en", "text": "Besides the control signals between the two centers where the tests are conducted, the data must be transmitted in an audio/video data system. And here the engineers encounter the main challenge. The point is to transport the image over long distances as quickly as possible. The difficulty lies in the fact that a high-resolution HD standard image contains very large amounts of data that must get from the operating field through the endoscopic system to the operator in another location. Only small delays are acceptable, otherwise it's difficult for doctors to coordinate their movements with the image reaching their eyes. The speed of the signal reaching the operator is crucial for the success of the operation. Contrary to appearances, the biggest source of delays is not the signal transmission itself, but the necessary change of its format from the original to one adapted for transmission over an Ethernet network consumes the most time. \"The image from a medical or industrial camera must be converted without significant loss of quality. The conversion, i.e., the change of image format, must occur at the source, where the image is captured, then via an Ethernet link the image is transmitted to the operator, and there it must be converted again to be displayed on a monitor or other visual elements,\" explains Dr. Eng. Jan Kowalski.", "redacted": 1}

During the visit she makes private phone calls (during my examination exactly 3).

Practically without an interview (she didn't have time because she was talking on the phone non-stop) and without reason, she referred me to the pregnancy pathology ward. Moreover, she didn't give me any referral to the hospital, nor did she write any justification. I was sent for a CTG (without reason), which later I had no one to consult with because the female doctor had already left. She is chaotic. She also sees 2 patients at once, which I find unacceptable. The same day, after the CTG, I saw another doctor (in the same hospital) who did a thorough interview, looked at all the test results, and examined me gynecologically. He confirmed my suspicions that there is no reason to keep me in the hospital and was additionally surprised that I was referred to the hospital without a referral, without reason, and without prior examination...", "redacted": 0}
