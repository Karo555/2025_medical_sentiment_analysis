I sent her the MRI description by email, and the description was on the disk; eventually, she wrote \"there was no MRI description.\" And that's one example! Ophthalmologist's indications are not taken into account. Everything she said was \"it happens with age.\" I'm only 37! Extremely unprofessional. The visit takes place at home; it's very stuffy and smells. At the same time, I waited as she was 30 minutes late! But she said she had no time for my questions!", "lang": "en"}

Did you pay for the visit? Yes? Then goodbye' (after she had already asked about it several times at the beginning and checked her phone to see if the transfer was there). DRAMA", "lang": "en"}
