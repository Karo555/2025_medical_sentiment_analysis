I already knew back then that this wasn't true,\" recalled Prof. Jan Kowalski. \"Definitely, over the past 50 years, there has been development. Humanity's dream is to avoid cancer, but this dream will probably never come true because the nature of biology is such that tumor formation must occur; it is one of the processes of nature. Our goal is to detect this process so early that cancer can be destroyed at the earliest possible stage, even when the patient is completely unaware they might be ill. I am an optimist – scientific discoveries will contribute to us talking about long survival and good quality of life,\" he added.", "redacted": 1}

Anna Kowalska from AGH, the metallic materials currently used in implantology differ in properties from our bones. Therefore, scientists are working on replacing them with polymers and polymer nanocomposites, as human bone is precisely a nanocomposite built from polymer and hydroxyapatite. Permanent implants, e.g., hip joint endoprostheses, do not undergo bioresorption in the human body, meaning they are not absorbed. There are also materials that may disappear in our body after some time. Dr. Pielichowska mainly seeks polymer materials for permanent implants and strives to make them as similar as possible to human bone tissue – both in terms of mechanical and chemical properties. In a grant funded by the National Science Centre, the researcher is working on composites based on a polymer called polyoxymethylene.", "redacted": 1}

You can see she cares about the patient; she didn't charge me for the ultrasound she performed to make sure she made the correct diagnosis because she said she would feel bad about it!

In my city, the doctor saw only one solution for me – surgery and cutting the breast. I was terrified. My daughter started searching online for breast specialists and found Dr. Bednarski. The next day, I decided to make an appointment. After arriving in Silesia, the doctor did an ultrasound and stated that it was a change that needed to be removed. He suggested a mammotomic biopsy, which is very minimally invasive and does not damage the breast, leaving only a small scratch after the procedure. After this procedure, you can return home immediately; believe me, it lasts less than 10 minutes and doesn't hurt at all. I warmly recommend Dr. Bednarski; he is not only an incredible specialist but also a wonderful person. I am very grateful to him for everything he did for me. I believe with all my heart that God sent him to me. Greetings, a patient from Kutno.", "redacted": 2}

The doctor took into account that for now I preferred to avoid using oral retinoids and proposed other treatment, which I hope will end successfully. I know it might vary, but regardless of the treatment outcome, I will certainly not give up on Dr. Anna Kowalska's services because, although I've visited many doctors, I have never encountered such a professional approach.

The electromagnetic wave – which is light – passes through tissues, and we examine its reflected signal. Based on this analysis, we are able to estimate some vital parameters of the human body – not only pulse, blood pressure, but also blood glucose level,\" explained Jan Kowalski. He added that the measurement methodology is based on the Lambert-Beer law, which assumes that both the amount of energy absorbed and scattered by a given type of molecule depends directly on its concentration in a given environment. \"So, the properties of light that has passed through tissue depend on the blood sugar level,\" he explained. He assured that his team precisely matched the wavelength to the properties of glucose molecules circulating in the human body, thanks to which the iSULIN system can determine its level with appropriate precision. The measuring device is small – it has the size of a wristwatch, which is connected to a smartphone via a Bluetooth module. The user should then install an application designed by the students on the smartphone. This application is supposed to help the patient maintain a balanced diet and enable contact with medical personnel. The students have already prepared a working prototype of the device, but before the system can hit the market, many tests leading to its final certification are needed. However, for now – as they warn – there are no ready-made devices of this type on sale yet.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_001029", "lang": "en", "text": "Hello everyone very warmly! I would like to join your assessments regarding the work of Prof. Jan Kowalski. In 1994 and 1996 (so quite a while ago), I was then 31 years old, and I was diagnosed with a cavernous hemangioma on the brainstem on the left pons. After many consultations in various centers in the country and refusal to remove the disease focus, the professor undertook to perform the procedure. The approach, as I mentioned earlier, was twofold – it succeeded. I think, P. Agnieszko, that perhaps the location was too dangerous and the most ordinary humility of the professor before the problem prevailed.", "redacted": 2}
{"opinion_id": "op_001030", "lang": "en", "text": "I came across the doctor by chance – the first and second visit, as a substitute for another doctor, went without any objections. Since the doctor I had chosen was often traveling, I switched to Dr. Jan Kowalski. I am a person who is reluctant to share opinions online, but frankly, to this day I am confused and bewildered by the doctor's approach. At first, I thought he misspoke – after all, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are similar-sounding words. On the third visit (already as his patient), I received a suggestion that I should increase the dose of medication because my TSH was dropping. I ignored the recommendation and consulted with my endocrinologist, who recommended maintaining the current dose unless TSH rises to 1.2 – 1.5. Moreover, he did not comment on the \"doubtful\" rubella antibody result, for which he himself referred me. The fourth visit was quite OK. So I thought that the doctor is also human; maybe he had a worse day the previous time. Unfortunately, on the next visit (already the fifth), the doctor again suggests increasing the thyroid hormone dose from 75 to 100 despite no change in the TSH result. I say that my endocrinologist suggested changing the dose at TSH values above 1, and he says, \"But you already have 0.45.\" Shock and disbelief! Increasing the thyroid hormone dose with TSH results maintaining at the lower limit of the safe range for pregnant women? I don't understand this... Or maybe Dr. Michalak doesn't understand the feedback mechanism? The last straw was the incident with the scale in the office, which showed a cosmic value – the doctor still entered the result into the chart, suggesting that it wasn't a big gain after all. I never weighed that much in my life! I gained 11kg equally throughout my entire first and second pregnancy, and now it's only the 22nd week and already 11 kilos plus! I have a scale at home and weigh myself regularly, especially since I am still physically active and exercise at the gym. Besides, a gain of 8 kg in just four weeks would suggest that something is probably wrong and would qualify me for some more detailed tests... Right, doctor?", "redacted": 2}

Then the treatment was changed to another, more pharmacological one. Currently, I undergo a \"regeneris\" procedure once a month. My skin has changed diametrically for the better. I believe that the medical, dermatological help I received from the doctor was and is tailored to each stage of treatment, and only such accurate, quick, and precise help ends in success. Systematicity, consistency, and patience both from the patient and the doctor yield positive results. Let's not expect that after one visit our damaged skin, dermatological, and aesthetic problems will change as if by magic. I highly recommend the doctor.", "redacted": 1}
