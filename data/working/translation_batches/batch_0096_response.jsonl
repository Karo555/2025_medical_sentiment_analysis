Generally, I can recommend him—he referred me for necessary tests, analyzed the results, and patiently answered my questions. I don't know how he would behave in case of complications or crisis situations—that's when you really see if a doctor is good. With my fairly problem-free pregnancy, it was okay; I gave birth to a healthy baby. A few times, the doctor annoyed me a bit by giving advice like 'please look up the answer to that question on Google' or 'if you want to go to the hospital, go, and if you don't, don't.' And I don't recommend going to him as the last patient of the day because he's already tapping his feet, eager to go home—though I totally understand that! :-) But overall, I recommend him.", "redacted": 1}

His office is open until 1 PM, but recently I witnessed a woman calling his office, and he told her to say he's there until 12! He stamps his feet because he has a private practice!

However, it is not a contagious disease. It often disappears and recurs on its own, which often misleads both patients and doctors. Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy. Over 60% of cases are diagnosed in the first year of life. However, it may disappear during childhood or at the latest by the end of adolescence. That's why it's so hard to recognize right away.

{"opinion_id": "op_001913", "lang": "en", "text": "As estimated by the project leader, about 1500 patients in Poland annually require reconstruction of craniofacial defects, particularly the mandible, during cancer treatment. Currently, this is done by transplanting bone fragments from various parts of the patient's body, e.g., the fibula. However, these are not fully effective procedures due to the risk of severe complications and mutilation of the sites from which the bone is taken. Therefore, it was necessary to search for new treatment methods. Such a need was reported by the project co-author—Dr. Jan Kowalski from the Oncology Center. \"Our joint project aims to develop a novel treatment method, considering the possibilities of tissue engineering. This means we support the patient in regenerating their own tissues by providing a synthetic material that serves as a tissue scaffold and stem cells taken from adipose tissue. They have the ability to form new tissue in the environment created by the implant,\" explains Dr. Święszkowski.", "redacted": 2}

{"opinion_id": "op_001920", "lang": "en", "text": "I went to Mr. Jan Kowalski with ankle pain. I sustained the injury much earlier, so it was an older case and previously untreated. The pain was increasing and preventing normal functioning. During the medical interview, I provided all the circumstances accompanying the presumed injury. Mr. Jan Kowalski stated that nothing serious was wrong with me, just that I overexerted it. I should be careful with the ankle and not overload it to let it regenerate, change the nature of my work and life (give up sports activities). When I asked if that was all, if it didn't require additional ultrasound, X-ray, even laboratory tests, medication, he said he didn't see the need, there was no point in spending money unnecessarily. The pain didn't subside, so I decided to go to another doctor, where at the first visit a preliminary diagnosis was made—inflammation of the peroneal muscle/ligament. The doctor without hesitation referred me for an ultrasound and laboratory tests. The tests confirmed the doctor's diagnosis, and additionally, fluid had formed in the tendon sheath. The only thing I'm grateful to Mr. Jan Kowalski for is giving me 2 weeks of sick leave, enabling regeneration, because the first doctor from the National Health Fund wasn't even kind enough to be interested in my case and downplayed it (thought I was faking? sic!). I chose Mr. Jan Kowalski because he presents himself as a specialist in sports injuries, but in my case, it's clear he doesn't really have a clue, as comparing the ankle examination by Mr. Jan Kowalski and the last doctor is like night and day. The last doctor checked the ankle area very thoroughly, centimeter by centimeter, and finally found the painful spot; Mr. Jan Kowalski unfortunately did it haphazardly. For a specialist in Poznań, I paid twice as much, but it was worth it. And the money spent on the visit with Mr. Jan Kowalski is money thrown down the drain—very weak in terms of merit.", "redacted": 2}
