According to her, to reduce the risk of breast cancer, one should eat plenty of vegetables, preferably of various colors. \"We can't overdo it with vegetables, there is no upper limit for consumption. But there is a lower limit - we shouldn't eat less than 400 grams per day,\" the specialist said. One should also remember to include fruits, whole grain cereal products, low-fat dairy products, fish, eggs, lean meat in the diet, and avoid processed products containing a large number of calories.", "redacted": 1}
{"opinion_id": "op_001862", "lang": "en", "text": "The difference is determined by warmer climatic conditions prevailing in cities due to the so-called urban heat island effect (UHI). As explained by Prof. Jan Kowalski from the Institute of Geography and Spatial Organization of the Polish Academy of Sciences, asphalt, reinforced concrete, and concrete building facades dominant in cities heat up strongly during summer days, and at night all this heat is transferred to the surroundings. As a result, the air temperature in city centers is higher (mainly at night and early morning) than in undeveloped areas by an average of 1-2°C. This seems little, but it can affect plant physiology - emphasizes Dr. Jan Kowalski. He added that several factors determine that plants in the city are more dangerous for allergy sufferers. \"In warmer urban conditions, plants produce more pollen, and additionally, the pollination period lengthens - plants start pollinating earlier and pollinate for a longer time,\" he explains.", "redacted": 2}

I came to the Professor after 12 years of struggles with various doctors - most often gynecologists and endocrinologists; having behind me various diagnoses or most often their absence, having experienced a huge number of uncontrolled behaviors of my body after taking a whole bunch of various unnecessary 'medicines', being hormonally unbalanced and on the verge of emotional exhaustion. As a result of the whole enormity of unpleasant and often dramatic experiences, I lost faith in the possibilities and skills of doctors. After a visit to the Professor's office, I believed that after all there are people who really want to help me and give hope for further normal life. The Professor referred me to another, in her opinion outstanding doctor, who could help me, guaranteeing the possibility of treatment by her if I were not satisfied with the new specialist. Usually after a year of treatment I lost faith in the competence of the new attending physician; this time it's different - I'm slowly gaining trust in his skills. I owe the possibility of treatment with this specialist to the Professor. I want to emphasize that Professor Anna Kowalska is the only specialist I trust boundlessly. Whenever I need it, she provides me with advice and support, and moreover, she does it selflessly - out of noble and pure desire to help. I never doubted the competence and professionalism of the Professor. Thanks to the Professor, I regained strength and desire to live, as well as for further treatment.", "redacted": 1}

Unfortunately, the doctor was 15 minutes late and the person before us was seen for 45 minutes!

Because with today's diseases and their complications, as a doctor you really need to be up to date. It seems to me that he approached my case very schematically. I had joint pains, they lasted up to 24 hours, then disappeared for a day or two, then returned, this pain simply 'walked' after me (today my wrist joint hurts, in two days for example my knee). The history he took from me about the disease was when I had a gynecological examination, dental examination and he sent me to an ENT specialist. I'll add that these examinations were OK. He prescribed medicine for joint inflammation. The pains didn't go away. My nightmare lasted about 1.5 years. Finally, I came across a doctor in Rzeszów (on health insurance). After describing the pains, she referred me for a Lyme disease and chlamydia test. It turned out I have chlamydia. An appropriate dose of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicine and the problem was gone!!!!", "redacted": 0}

Initially I was satisfied, but over time I had increasing doubts and finally they found credible confirmation. Let's start with the advantages. The Doctor is certainly a master when it comes to contact with the patient. She can quickly establish good rapport. Visits to Her are a pleasure. And in this part I agree with all the other people who posted these positive opinions. Reducing the stress associated with such a visit is definitely a plus. However, competence is primarily expected from a doctor. Honestly - I prefer a doctor who is aloof but effective. The Doctor did not explain even once the exact reasons for such and not other action and the exact mechanisms of action of a given medicine despite asking precise questions. It would seem that she simply doesn't have time for it, that it's complicated, etc. However, after over 6 months of ineffective action, I decided to try another doctor. Immediately a much more 'specialist' approach and greater knowledge were visible. I also heard statements completely contradictory to those uttered by Doctor Anna Kowalska. And disbelief at some (incompetent) actions of the Doctor. My new doctor solved the problem of my circadian rhythm disorders in 1 month, while Doctor Anna Kowalska for 6 months only told me to 'overcome myself with earlier getting up' or gave ineffective, addictive medicines. If your problem is quite simple in terms of treatment selection - it's possible that a doctor who establishes good contact is a good choice.
